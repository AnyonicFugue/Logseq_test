- Characteristic polynomial of [[Topological Order]]? #Possibility #Research
	- Thought
		- We may always study an object in various contexts.
		- Automorphism group is always a good thing to study. #Thoughts
	- Motivation
		- Invertible [[Domain walls]] are automorphisms of the braided fusion categories.
		- On the other hand, field extensions are 1-1 with Galois groups.
	- Clues
		- Field extensions may be viewed as vector fields on the irreducible objects. **Natural linear structure!**
		- Moreover, multiplication is also present.
		- Kitaev mentioned 'Unsolvability of the group seems important'. ![2003_Kitaev_Fault-tolerant quantum computation by anyons.pdf](file://C:/Users/10309/Nutstore/1/sync/zotero/Physics/Topological order/2003_Kitaev_Fault-tolerant quantum computation by anyons.pdf) P25
	- Difficulties
		- Multiplication is abelian. Hard to obtain nonabelian things.
		- We cannot distinguish between different fusion paths; only the final outcome can be read off in scalar multiplications.
	- Possible solutions
		- The numbers in the extensions may not directly correspond to the whole category, but only a part. **Thus the word characteristic**.
		- Use ring extensions rather than field extensions, for example, extensions of the integer ring $\mathbb Z[\alpha]$.
		- Strange things like 'matrix extensions'
		- View excitations as polynomials and adopt more exotic things like [[Groebner Basis]]?
	- ## Start from simple examples! Toric code, quantum double (perhaps $Z_n$ for simplicity), etc.

			- No need to understand everything; capture the spirit and note a few examples.
		- LATER Try to construct extensions for toric code and quantum doubles. ((639a7c9d-c8af-411a-9b3e-45e5cc6792af))
