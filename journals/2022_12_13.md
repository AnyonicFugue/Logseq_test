- Zee's lecture #[[To be recorded]]
	- Effect of eastern culture
		- Nambu missed quarks because he believed that particles can only have integer charges...
		- His first-grade son: Fact or opinion?
	- Counterexample. A postdoc who has read lots of textbooks: Calculate 60 pages without intuition, but a single error in copying made it all wrong...
		- Zee's advice: Lock up all your books in the cardboard!
	- Examples of inspired guesses
		- Bohr: Came up with the energy of the Hydrogen atoms with total nonsense
			- He even mistook the ground state angular momentum (which is zero)
		- Planck: Made a wild guess, even introduce a new fundamental constant by dimension analysis!
		- Laughlin wave function: Write down a wavefunction without a Hamiltonian
			- He tried hard before writing down the WF. **Continuous thinking and hard work are necessary.**
	- How to train the intuition? #card
		- Calculate and argue without pen or paper.
		- Capture the essence!

- Tip from QFT HW6, dimensional regularization of scalar QED
	- If you find a mysterious extra term, sometimes it {{cloze vanishes, e.g. Due to symmetry}}
