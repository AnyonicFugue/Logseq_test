- # Statement
	- For a infinite number of generators the canonical commutation relations do not have a unique (up to isomorphism) irreducible unitary representation.
	- The theorem goes on to say that, therefore, theÂ interaction picture in an interacting quantum field theory does not behave as in quantum mechanics. #[[Research/To Be Investigated]]
		- More precisely, these two representations of the algebra isn't equivalent.
