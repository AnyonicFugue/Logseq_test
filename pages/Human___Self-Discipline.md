		- Improve incrementally. 小步走。
		- Convert discipline into a habit and a source of **pleasure**.
			- This could be praising myself and feeling proud.
		- Find passionate goals and work towards them.
	- ## Techniques #card
		- As soon as a valuable activity comes to your mind that you are really unwilling to do, **do it**.
			- Stand over a pool of cold water. Do you hate jumping in? Do it. The more you hate it, the sooner you should jump.
			- Note that the activity is **beneficial** and result in **happiness** rather than lasting stress and discomfort.
	- ## Do Not... #card
		- Force myself to do things when sick or sleepy.
			- If I'm sick, stop working. If I'm sleepy, go to sleep.
			- Comply with my biological nature.
