		- Improve incrementally. 小步走。
		- Convert discipline into a habit and a source of **pleasure**.
			- This could be praising myself and feeling proud.
		- Find passionate goals and work towards them.
	- ## Techniques #card
		- 五次呼吸法
			- Tell myself: I would do it after five breathing!
			- This is tested a lot and proved useful. Maybe because it provides some acute pressure.
		- 手机闹钟作为开始五次呼吸的发令信号。
			- 听到闹钟立刻去做是困难的，但是开始呼吸是容易的。
		- As soon as a valuable activity comes to your mind that you are really unwilling to do, **do it**.
			- Stand over a pool of cold water. Do you hate jumping in? Do it. The more you hate it, the sooner you should jump.
			- Note that the activity is **beneficial** and result in **happiness** rather than lasting stress and discomfort.
	- ## Do Not... #card
		- Force myself to do things when sick or sleepy.
			- If I'm sick, stop working. If I'm sleepy, go to sleep.
			- Comply with my biological nature.

- # 愿景
	- Self-discipline would gradually become a habit and a pleasure.
	- Benefits of earlier effort would gradually appear: Sharper brain, larger knowledge base, etc.
