	- Note that there's a difference, since the evolution operators are in $SU(2)$ (rather than $\mathfrak{su}(2)$, or Paulis), though they do have intimate relationships.
	-
	- Elements of $SU(2)$ can be expressed in the form
	  $$
	  A=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
	  \alpha & -\bar{\beta} \\
	  \beta & \bar{\alpha}
	  \end{array}\right)
	  $$
	  with $|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1$.
	- Therefore, a general $SU(2)$ operator can be expressed as a **linear combination** of $\left\{I, \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z\right\}$.
		- However the converse is **not** true.
	- This is quite uncommon. Usually we do not talk about matrix addition of the group elements; rather we talk about their multiplication, or addition of generators.
	-
	- Therefore we're actually talking about properties of a certain **representation.**
