- # Intro
	- Different from vortex proliferation in 2D [[Superfluid]]
		- Energy cost diverges >= logarithmically
	- Similar to 2D superconductors
		- Vortices are point defects, with long-range statitics
		- ((63d873c2-b58b-4e3b-8469-3fe30da04a61))
		- However, vortices in superconductors are created by external fields, whereas anyons are excited states of the Hamiltonian.
