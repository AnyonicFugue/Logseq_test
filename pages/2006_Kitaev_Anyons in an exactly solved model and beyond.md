	- What's the reason?
	-
	- It seems the existence of gap is related to a short correlation length.
- Argument: Degeneracy on Torus
	- Denote the operation of creating an e pairs, move around torus horizontally and annihilate as $A$. 
	  Denote ... m pairs ... vertically as $B$.
	- Note that $A$ and $B$ both preserve the ground space.
	- If the phase is nontrivial, $ABA^{-1}B^{-1} \neq I$, thus the ground space must be nontrivial.
