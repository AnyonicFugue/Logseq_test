- ## Paradox of [[Thermalization]] #card
	- Key idea
		- A thermalized system can be described by a few parameters (temperature, chemical potential, etc). Note that each parameter corresponds to a conserved quantity.
		- In other words, all information other than the few parameters are **erased**.
		- But unitary evolutions are invertible and cannot erase information! What happened?

	- Possible solutions
		- The initial local information is spread across the system (by [[Entanglement]]) and becomes global.
		- Since we cannot measure global operators, this part of information becomes inaccessible.
- # Def
	- Thermalization of a quantum system #card
		- For an arbitrary (local) partition of the Hilbert space into $H=A \otimes B$ with $\frac {|A|}{|X|} \to 0$ (a small fraction) in the thermodynamic limit,
		  $$\lim_{t \to \infty} \rho_A(t) = \rho^{(eq)}_A(t)$$
	- The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH)
		- All eigenstates of $\hat H$ could thermalize (in the thermodynamic limit),
		- It is a hypothesis; seems not true for a wide range of systems.
