alias:: Stress-Energy Tensor

-
- Definition from Noether's theorem
	- $$\mathcal{T}_{\mu \nu}=\sum_{n} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial\left(\partial_{\mu} \phi_{n}\right)} \partial_{\nu} \phi_{n}-g_{\mu \nu} \mathcal{L}$$
		- Note that $\mathcal L$ is **not** invariant under translation, but up to a 4-current $\partial_\mu \mathcal L$.
		- The last term is to compensate for the non-invariance.

- Derivation
- Alternative definition in GR
	- $$
	  T_{a b}=-\frac{\alpha_M}{8 \pi} \frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}} \frac{\delta S_M}{\delta g^{a b}}
	  $$
