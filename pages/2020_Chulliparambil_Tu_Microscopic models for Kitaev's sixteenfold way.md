- # The Models
- # Characterization of Topo Orders
	- Two features: GSD and topological spin
	- Topo spin
		- Still using boundary CFT
		- Key formula: For two different sectors on a finite boundary,
		  $$E_a-E_0=\frac{2\pi v}{L_1}(h_a+h_{\bar a})$$
			- Citing big yellow book
			- $a$ labels a primary field ( $\bar{a}$ being its conjugate)
			- $h_a$ is the conformal weight of this field (with $h_a=h_{\bar{a}}$ )
			- $v$ is velocity of the CFT.
		- The topological spin of the anyon is related to $h_a$ via $\theta=2 \pi h_a$.
		- $v$ is extracted from the linear dispersion of the edge spectrum.
