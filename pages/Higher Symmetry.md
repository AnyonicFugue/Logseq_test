# Definitions
	- k-form symmetry
		- Acts on all closed subspaces of codimension k and becomes the identity operator if the closed subspaces are contractible.
	- k-symmetry
		- Acts on closed subspaces of codimension k, but it does not become the identity operator when the closed subspaces are contractible.
		- For example, conventional on-site symmetries are 0-symmetries.
	- Higher symmetry
		- A (k-)symmetry in a lattice model.
		- A higher symmetry reduces to a higher form symmetry in the ground-state subspaces.
	- Group-like higher symmetry
		- The generators $W_\alpha\left(S^p\right)$ are labeled by an index $\alpha$ and $S^p$ (a $p$-dimensional closed submanifold), and $W_\alpha\left(S^p\right)$ only acts on the degrees of freedom near $S^p$.
		- For a group-like higher symmetry, the $k$-dimensional operators satisfy a group-like algebra
		  $$
		  W_\alpha\left(S^p\right) W_\beta\left(S^p\right)=W_\gamma\left(S^p\right),
		  $$
	- Algebraic higher symmetry
		- The generators satisfy a more general multiplication algebra:
		  $$
		  W_\alpha\left(S^p\right) W_\beta\left(S^p\right)=\sum_\gamma N_{\alpha \beta}^\gamma W_\gamma\left(S^p\right)
		  $$
		- In this case, the symmetry generator $W_\alpha\left(S^p\right)$ may be **neither invertible nor unitary**.
			- Such kind of algebraic symmetries was studied in $1+1 \mathrm{D}$ conformal field theory via noninvertible defect lines (where invertible defect lines are known to connect to symmetry) [20-23].
