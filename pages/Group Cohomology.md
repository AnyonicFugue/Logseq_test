# Definition
	- The collection of all G-modules is a category.
		- The morphisms are group homomorphisms $f$ with the property $f(g x)=g(f(x))$ for all $g$ in $G$ and $x$ in $M$.
	- Sending each module $M$ to the group of invariants $M^G$ yields a functor from the category of $G$-modules to the category $\mathbf{A b}$ of abelian groups.
	- This functor is left exact but not necessarily right exact. We may therefore form its right derived functors.
	- Their values are abelian groups and they are denoted by $H^n(G, M)$, "the $n$-th cohomology group of $G$ with coefficients in $M$ ". Furthermore, the group $H^0(G, M)$ may be identified with $M^G$.
