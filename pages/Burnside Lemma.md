	- Given a finite group $G$ acting 1 on a set $X$. The number of orbits in $X$ due to this group action is given by
	  $$
	  \text { number of orbits }=\frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{h \in G}\left(\begin{array}{c}
	  \text { number of elements of } X \\
	  \text { that are left unchanged by } h
	  \end{array}\right)
	  $$
	- There is no relationship with group representations!

		- To count the number of irreps of the 'action representation',
		  $$\text{\#irrep}=\langle\chi,\chi\rangle\\=\frac 1 {|G|} \sum_g \chi(g)^2$$
		- This is **different** from the above formula.
		- Take the group generated by $e$ and $\sigma_x$ for example.
			- 1 orbit, 2 irrep.
	- Proof
		- Key proposition: Size of orbit of $x$ = $\frac{|G|}{|C(x)|}$
		- The number of orbits could be expressed by a sum. Moreover, the order of summation could be interchanged.
