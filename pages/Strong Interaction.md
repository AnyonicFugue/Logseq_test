- # Strange Experimental Phenomena
	- When hitting the proton with a electron, the scattering section of the electron behaves as if the proton is a hard particle. However, the proton is shattered into pieces rather than remaining as a whole.
	- Explanation
		- Obviously proton is a composite particle.
		- Strong interaction have [[Asymptotic Freedom]], that is, the coupling constant tends to zero as the momenta tends to infinity.
			- It is the opposite case for [[QED]].
		- Therefore, the electromagnetic interaction is 'hard' while the strong interaction is 'small'.
