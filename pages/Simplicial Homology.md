	  collapsed:: true
		- A simplicial complex $K$ with a partial order, such that the restriction to vertices of any simplex is a linear order.
		- Why not a full order on the whole complex?
		  background-color:: red
			- For simplexes with common faces, their ordering must be compatible, but the orders may not naturally merge.
			- In short, 'partial order' means $a<b>c$ or $a>b<c$.
			- For example,
			  ![Image.png](../assets/Image_1698993333587_0.png){:height 261, :width 455}
				- The two orderings are compatible, but they do not merge.
	- $C_q(K)$
		- An abelian group with the following presentation:
			- Generators
				- All $(q+1)$-tuples $\left(p_0, \ldots, p_q\right)$ with $p_i \in \operatorname{Vert}(K)$ such that $\left\{p_0, \ldots, p_q\right\}$ spans a simplex in $K$.
			- Relations
				- (i) $\left(p_0, \ldots, p_q\right)=0$ if some vertex is repeated;
				- (ii) $\left(p_0, \ldots, p_q\right)=(\operatorname{sgn} \pi)\left(p_{\pi 0}, p_{\pi 1}, \ldots, p_{\pi q}\right)$, where $\pi$ is a permutation of $\{0,1, \ldots, q\}$.

	- ### Basic Facts
		- Lemma. Let $K$ be an oriented simplicial complex of dimension $m$.
		  (i) $C_q(K)$ is a free abelian group with basis all symbols $\left\langle p_0, \ldots, p_q\right\rangle$, where $\left\{p_0, \ldots, p_q\right\}$ spans a q-simplex in $K$ and $p_0<p_1<\cdots<p_q$. Moreover, $\left\langle p_{\pi 0}, \ldots, p_{\pi q}\right\rangle=(\operatorname{sgn} \pi)\left\langle p_0, \ldots, p_q\right\rangle$.
		  (ii) $C_q(K)=0$ for all $q>m$.
		- Theorem. $C_*(K) := \{C_q(K),\partial_q\}$ is a chain complex.
			- Same argument as before.
		- Lemma. If $\varphi: K \rightarrow L$ is a simplicial map, then $\varphi_{\#}: C_*(K) \rightarrow C_*(L)$ is a chain map; that is, $\varphi_{\#} \partial=\partial \varphi_{\#}$.
	- Theorem. For each $q \geq 0, H_q: \mathscr{K} \rightarrow \mathbf{A b}$ is a functor.
	- The dimensional axiom holds trivially.
	- ((65459d61-e66d-4c7c-8baa-f513b497e4c1)) (Excision). If $K_1$ and $K_2$ are subcomplexes of a simplicial complex $K$ with $K_1 \cup K_2=K$, then the inclusion $\left(K_1, K_1 \cap K_2\right) \hookrightarrow\left(K, K_2\right)$ induces isomorphisms, for all $q \geq 0$,
	  $$
	  H_q\left(K_1, K_1 \cap K_2\right) \stackrel{\sim}{\rightarrow} H_q\left(K, K_2\right) .
	  $$
		- The verification is much simpler than that of singular homology, since $K_1 \cup K_2=K$ means that all simplexes of $K$ are contained in $K_1$ or $K_2$.
		- #+BEGIN_NOTE
		  Historically, the version for simplicial homology appeared first. It is understandable that people can observe the fact! Not pulled out of a hat!
		  #+END_NOTE
	- Theorem. (Mayer-Vietoris) If $K_1$ and $K_2$ are subcomplexes of a simplicial complex $K$ with $K_1 \cup K_2=K$, then there is an exact sequence
	  $$
	  \cdots \rightarrow H_{q+1}(K) \rightarrow H_q\left(K_1 \cap K_2\right) \rightarrow H_q\left(K_1\right) \oplus H_q\left(K_2\right) \rightarrow H_q(K) \rightarrow H_{q-1}\left(K_1 \cap K_2\right) \rightarrow \cdots
	  $$

	- How could I invent it were I Poincare?
	- Definition
	  id:: 65449fbd-691c-4c46-b321-9ac7fd2bd3c6
		- Let $K$ be a simplicial complex of dimension $m$. For each $q \geq 0$, let $\alpha_q$ be the number of $q$-simplexes in $K$.
		- The Euler-PoincarÃ© characteristic of $K$, denoted by $\chi(K)$, is defined by
		  $$
		  \chi(K)=\sum_{q=0}^m(-1)^q \alpha_q .
		  $$
	- Theorem. If $K$ is an oriented simplicial complex of dimension $m$, then
	  $$
	  \chi(K)=\sum_{q=0}^m(-1)^q \operatorname{rank} H_q(K)
	  $$
		- We immediately see it is a very weak invariant, but nonetheless useful since it can be directly read off from the triangulation without any further calculation.
		- Observations
			- About rank
				- Rank has two distinct meanings. The first is the min. number of generators, while the second is the number of generators of the free-abelian part.
				- Let me take the second, since it satisfies $\operatorname{rank}(G/H)=\operatorname{rank}G-\operatorname{rank}H$.
				-
		- Key points
			- $$
			  \operatorname{rank} H_q(K)=\operatorname{rank} Z_q(K)-\operatorname{rank} B_q(K)
			  $$
			- $$
			  \alpha_q=\operatorname{rank} C_q(K)=\operatorname{rank} Z_q(K)+\operatorname{rank} B_{q-1}(K)
			  $$
		- Actually this result holds for **any** chain complex with each term free abelian.
- # Promote the functor to Polyhedra
  collapsed:: true
	- Possible problems
		- Prove the invariance under equivalent triangulations.
		- We only have simplicial maps in the category of simplicial complexes, $\mathscr{K}$, while we have continuous maps between polyhedra.
			- Obviously we need simplicial approximations.
		- Then we need to prove the invariance under equivalent simplicial approximations.
	- ### Compare $H_q(K)$ and $H_q(\operatorname{Sd} K)$
		- Proposition. Let $K$ be a (finite) oriented simplicial complex of dimension $m$.
		  (i) $H_q(K)$ is f.g. (finitely generated) for every $q \geq 0$.
		  (ii) $H_q(K)=0$ for all $q>m$.
		  (iii) $H_m(K)$ is free abelian, possibly zero.
			- (i) is trivial.
			- (ii) Since $C_q(K)$=0.
			- (iii) The boundary is zero and the cycle part is necessarily free abelian.

- # Equivalence with singular homology #card
	- ((65459f47-ac98-40a4-a2ce-280815a295c1))
	  collapsed:: true
		- If we could prove equivalence with singular homology, then it is trivial that simplicial homology doesn't depend on the triangulation chosen.
	- Takeaway message
		- First show their equivalence on some simple objects (simplexes and faces)
		- The change of homology groups during gluing simplexes could be tracked by Mayer-Vietoris, which holds for both simplicial and singular homology.
	- Preparations
		- ((65460340-5044-49c4-9074-f56ef78fa13c)). Let $K$ be the simplicial complex consisting of all the faces of an $n$-simplex whose vertex set is linearly ordered (so that $|K| \approx \Delta^n$ ). Then

		  $$

			- An very interesting technical exercise.

			  collapsed:: true
			  $$\partial_{q+1} h_q+h_{q-1} \partial_q=1_q$$
				- Why is it important?

		- Corollary. Let $K$ consist of all the faces of an oriented $n$-simplex (so that $\operatorname{Vert}(K)$ is linearly ordered), and let $L$ be the subcomplex of all the proper faces (so that $|L| \approx S^{n-1}$ ). Then

		-
		- Difficulty: Excision in singular homology requires $X = X_1^\circ \cup X_2^\circ$, while this doesn't hold in general for a simplicial complex and two subcomplexes. Thus we should make some minor modifications.
		- Lemma. Let $K$ be a finite simplicial complex, and let $s$ be a simplex of highest dimension; define $K_1=K-\{s\}$ and $K_2=\{s$ and all its proper faces $\}$. Then there is an exact Mayer-Vietoris sequence in singular homology

	- **Main Theorem**. For every oriented finite simplicial complex $K$, the chain map $j: \widetilde{C}_*(K) \rightarrow \widetilde{S}_*(|K|)$ (of Lemma 7.21) induces isomorphisms for all $q \geq 0$,
	  $$
	  \widetilde{H}_q(K) \cong \tilde{H}_q(|K|)
	  $$
		- These all seem rather natural -- I've improved!
		  background-color:: yellow
			- But the underlying thought is still fascinating. The five lemma is an essential step, which seems completely algebraic rather than geometric. Why?
			- ((654991d3-5f8c-4985-9ade-ed226450dfe7))...
				- First attempts to prove the independence of triangulation were aimed at the polyhedron itself.
				- For many years, people tried to prove the **Hauptvermutung** (principle conjecture): 
				  if $(K, h)$ and $(L, g)$ are triangulations of a polyhedron $X$, then there are subdivisions (not necessarily barycentric) $K^{\prime}$ of $K$ and $L^{\prime}$ of $L$ with $K^{\prime} \cong L^{\prime}$. Were this true, there would be an easy proof of the topological invariance of $H_*(K)$.
				- The Hauptvermutung was proved for $n=3$ by Moise (in the 1950s), but in 1961 Milnor constructed **counterexamples** to it for every $n \geq 6$.
				- So the theorem had to be cracked 'from outside'.
		- We proceed by gradually gluing simplexes to the existing complex.
		- To prove that the homology groups remains isomorphic after gluing a new simplex, we use the five lemma.
			- ((654990cc-f96d-4962-949a-564aaefb1dca))
			- Note that $K_2$ is a simplex, thus $\tilde H_q(K)=\tilde H_q(|K|)=0$.
		- The key step is to prove $j_*:H_{q-1}\left(K_1 \cap K_2 \right) \to H_{q-1}\left(\left|K_1\right| \cap\left|K_2\right|\right)$ is an isomorphism.
			- My original viewpoint was problematic.
			  background-color:: red
				- I wish to each time glue a simplex plus all its proper faces.
				- But then $|K_1| \cup |K_2|$ might not be all proper faces of the simplex glued, thus excision might not hold.
			- The correct way is to induct on the number of simplexes and each time only glue a 'bulk' of a highest-dimensional simplex, thus excision still works.
				- In other words, we start from an 0D simplicial complex and gradually add dimension by gluing more and more 'bulk'.
	- Corollary. The simplicial homology groups of a polyhedron doesn't depend on the choice of the triangulation.

			- ((654de5ae-2d0a-4eb3-933a-8770ccd3baf2)). Normal form
				- A normal form is an $m \times n$ matrix $N$ over $\mathbf{Z}$ such that
				  $$
				  N=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
				  \Delta & 0 \\
				  0 & 0
				  \end{array}\right],

				  where $\Delta$ is a diagonal matrix, say, $\Delta=\operatorname{diag}\left\{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k\right\}$, with $b_1\left|b_2\right| \cdots \mid b_k$.
				- Since f.g. abelian groups are completely determined by generators, any homomorphism is completely determined by the matrix.
			- Theorem (Smith Normal Form). Every rectangular matrix $D$ over $\mathbf{Z}$ can be transformed, using elementary row and column operations, into a normal form; moreover, this normal form is independent of the elementary operations and is thus uniquely determined by $D$.
				- The usual proof is itself an algorithm.
		- Theorem. For any oriented simplicial complex $K$, there is an algorithm to compute $H_q(K)$ for all $q \geq 0$.
		  collapsed:: true
			- In short, since $C_q(K)$ are finitely generated, we could express $\partial_q$ by matrices with coefficients over $\mathbb Z$, which can be made into the normal form.
				- $Z_q(K)$ corresponds to the zero blocks.
				- It's easy to see that the nonzero diagonal elements are torsion coefficients (if some are 1 then they vanish in $Z_q/B_q$)
			- However, this method isn't practical. It used to show the existence of an algorithm, thus the problem must be computable.

		- $p$ is called the origin of $e$ and $q$ is called the end of $e$.

		- Proposition. If $\varphi, \psi: K \rightarrow L$ are contiguous, then $|\varphi| \simeq|\psi|$.
			- Just construct a homotopy $F: |K| \times I \to |L|$ by
