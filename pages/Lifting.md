	- In other words, each path have several 'copies' in the covering space, with different starting points.
	- Proof
		- 1. Find a set of open sets $\{U_j\}$, which are evenly covered by p.
		- 2. Divide $[0,1]$ into several closed intervals $\{[s_i,s_{i+1}]\}$ such that $f([s_i,s_{i+1}])$ is entirely contained in some $U_{j_i}$
			- The existence of the division is guaranteed by [[The Lebesgue number lemma]]. **[0,1] is a compact metric space!**
			- The construction has several merits: Each set is closed, whose endpoints can be used; the collection is finite (Let alone [[Countable]] ), which allows induction.
		- 3. Proceed inductively to define $\bar f$.
			- The intervals are mapped back by $p^{-1}$ into disjoint slices.
			- The endpoints grant a unique choice.

	- The strategy is similar to Lemma 54.1 : Construct a finite collection of closed sets (For example, rectangles), then define $\bar F$ on them one by one.
	- It's also easy to verify that $\bar F$ is a path homotopy. We only need to verify the extra condition that the endpoints are fixed.
