- # What this page is used for
	- Make them into flashcards. Thus I'll have an arsenal when facing new problems.
		- Understanding the strategies of the previous masters is quite delightful.
	- Extract [[Thoughts/Math and Physics]].
- Dirty way: Install a basis/coordinate and verify things directly.

- Try equivalent forms of an object!

	- Sometimes, a form would be significantly simpler than another.

- Embed the object under investigation into better spaces.

- Find a characteristic. If it is different for two objects, then they must be different. #card

	- The same for trace, determinant, cardinality and the [[Fundamental Group]].
	- Actually [simplifying the information](((64116664-78ea-458f-b45f-db085090d9cf))) to make things easier.
		- eg. First homology: Abelian groups are easier than general ones.
- Construct a differential equation. #card

	- Different objects can be shown to be identical by uniqueness of solution.
	- Solving an **infinitesimal local property** is often way easier than tackling the **global** thing!
	- More generally, if we have a structure of manifold, we may view some quantity as the value of a field **at a point**.
	  The field has some better 'global' property and might be viewed as an 'integral curve'.
- Use a set of elementary moves. Prove invariance under each element of the set. #card

	- Quite interesting. So useful in classification and invariance (equivalence) problems.
- Divide a big problem into subproblems.
	- Decompose a large space into a direct sum / path components / union of parts.

- # [[Algebraic Topology]]
	- Prove nulhomotopy by rescale the shape (in particular, curve) with a parameter $t\in [0,1]$
		- Especially useful for shapes embeddable into $R^n$
- # Physics
	- By analyzing the only possible quantities and dependences, we can obtain some nontrivial relations.
