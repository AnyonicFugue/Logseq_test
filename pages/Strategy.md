- Dirty way: Install a basis/coordinate and verify things directly.

	- Sometimes, a form would be significantly simpler than another.

- Find a characteristic. If it is different for two objects, then they must be different.

	- The same for trace, determinant, cardinality and the [[Fundamental group]]. #Strategy

	- Prove nulhomotopy by rescale the shape (in particular, curve) with a parameter $t\in [0,1]$
		- Especially useful for shapes embeddable into $R^n$
- Use a set of elementary moves. Prove invariance under each element of the set.

	- Quite interesting. So useful in classification and invariance (equivalence) problems.
- # Physics
	- By analyzing the only possible quantities, we can obtain some nontrivial relations.
