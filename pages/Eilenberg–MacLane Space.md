# Definition
	- Let $G$ be a group and $n$ a positive integer.
	- A connected topological space $X$ is called an Eilenberg-MacLane space of type $K(G, n)$, if it has $n$ th homotopy group $\pi_n(X)$ isomorphic to $G$ and all other homotopy groups trivial.
- # Properties
	- Assuming that $G$ is abelian in the case that $n>1$, Eilenberg-MacLane spaces of type $K(G, n)$ always exist, and are all weak homotopy equivalent.
