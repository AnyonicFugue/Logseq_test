- Notably, it provides a complete answer to the question of whether the boundary between two topological phases can be gapped, and whether a given pair of phases admits multiple distinct gapped boundary types.43–5

- a TSB transition relates the Chern-Simons theory with gauge group G = SU (2) to that with gauge group G = SO(3); however there is **no** Higgs field that reduces the gauge symmetry from SU (2) to SO(3), since these have the same Lie algebra. .

- If not, we arrive at a contradiction, and will be forced to conclude that either the upper boundary is also gapped, or the lower boundary is gapless – i.e. the upper and lower boundaries are not individually gappable.
