- Notably, it provides a complete answer to the question of whether the boundary between two topological phases can be gapped, and whether a given pair of phases admits multiple distinct gapped boundary types.43–5

- while(at least for some topological orders) it can describe a process in which the topological order is completely destroyed, an alternative framework is needed to describe the reverse process, in which the topological order is created from the vacuum.
