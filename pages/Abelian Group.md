  (i) $G=F \oplus T$, where $F$ is free abelian of finite rank $r \geq 0$ and $T$ is finite.
  (ii) $T$ is a direct sum of cyclic groups, $T=C_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus C_k$, with order $C_i=b_i$, say, and with $b_1\left|b_2\right| \cdots \mid b_k\left(b_1 \mid b_2\right.$ means " $b_1$ divides $b_2$ "). The numbers $b_1$, $\ldots, b_k$ are called the **torsion coefficients** of $G$.
  (iii) rank $F$ and the torsion coefficients are invariants of $G$, and two f.g. abelian groups are isomorphic if and only if they have the same rank and the same torsion coefficients. #card
