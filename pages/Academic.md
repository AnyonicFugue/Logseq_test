		- The problem may be solved by holding several 'partial solutions' together.
			- Therefore you may study under what conditions a partial solution hold and glue multiple together.
		- Moreover, the reason for the failure is often quite instructive.
			- Why it doesn't work? How can we fix the defect?
		- Failure is a beneficial part of research.
	- There's more than rigor and proof. [[Academic]]
		- To become mature, we need to learn to be rigorous. But that's not the end of things; proceeding only with rigorous formality is extremely slow.
		- The final stage shall be a good [[Intuition]] supported by a sound knowledge of the formalisms.
			- This doesn't contradict Kong's 'thinking slowly'. What Kong meant should be 'observe the characteristics of the problem carefully, and think slowly with intuition'.

	- Inspiration isn't a lucky or random event. It comes out of long-term accumulation.
		- Luck is for those who are prepared. Erdös liked to say, "My brain is open".

		- Sometimes I'm stuck by a single typo or an unexpected term when reading papers.
			- In contrast, a few spelling errors or misusage of words don't affect reading in common English.
		- Generally, we have a broad picture when reading common English and we can infer some lost information from other places. This also applies to reading papers.
		- Solutions
			- Ignore the hard thing temporarily and read a bit further to find an explanation/application.
				- Note that you shall keep that thing in mind (or in some note)
			- Rethink the logical dependencies. Is the thing really deduced from that immediately above?
			- Project the paper to simpler subspaces.
				- First analyze a toy model.
				- If the paper deals with a big theorem/conclusion, we may first analyze only a part of it.
					- For example, a formula has a main term and a negligible error term. We may first analyze the main term, then turn to the error term.
