- # Projects
	- [[Leakage in TQC by Fibonacci anyons]]
		- ## TODOs
			- Read appendix A in *An intro to rep of groups*
		- ## Possible Strategies
			- Add one braiding at a time and investigate how the form evolves
			- First write out the subgroups generated by any two of the braidings, then explore how they might be sewn together
			- More number theory
				- Make use of trace and norm of algebraic numbers, which are quite good invariants (characteristics)
				- Characteristic polynomial and minimal polynomial
				- Discriminant
			- Find a **characteristic** to show that the gates generated by braidings cannot be both leakage-free and entangling.
				- We need some quantum tomography (as in the papers which introduced the geometric invariants to determine whether the gate is entangling)?

- # Thoughts
	- Precise definitions of topological orders
		- The problem is what is the Hamiltonian.
		- At first glimpse it is obvious; but what does 'the Hamiltonian when taking the thermodynamic limit' means?
			- Should be independent of the way you take the thermodynamic limit.

		- Tentative answers
			- A universal function of the graph
		- Can I construct an intriguing counterexample, where intuitive definitions of the Hamiltonian would lead to contradictions?
