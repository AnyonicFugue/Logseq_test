- Precise definitions of topological orders
	- The problem is what is the Hamiltonian.
	- At first glimpse it is obvious; but what does 'the Hamiltonian when taking the thermodynamic limit' means?
		- Should be independent of the way you take the thermodynamic limit.
	- Tentative answers
		- A universal function of the graph
	- Can I construct an intriguing counterexample, where intuitive definitions of the Hamiltonian would lead to contradictions?
