- # Questions
	- Asymptotic states like Kitaev's honeycomb?
	  A natural framework to incorporate LU?
		- The problem is, for regions like the annulus and 2-hole disk, we can't naturally define an asymptotic info convex set, since there is not an embedding from the latter term to the former.
		- Define something like 'stable ICS' (which does not require an embedding)?
		- Yuan's suggestion: We do not try to make the set of good states closed under general LU, only define two good states to be equivalent if they can be connected by LU.
- # Setup
	- Consider a sequence of disks $\{D_n\}$.
		- Each disk $D_n$ consists of $N_n$ sites $1,...,N_n$, with a vector space $V_i \cong \mathbb C^\infty$ on each site. The Hilbert space of $D_n$ is 
		  $$\mathcal H_n=\otimes_{i=1}^{N_n} V_i$$
			-
		- Each disk $D_n$ is assigned with a density matrix $\rho_n \in Hom(\mathcal H_n)$.
			- We call $\rho_n$ **good** if it satisfies Bowen's A0 and A1 in the bulk.
			- The key is to derive the isomorphism theorem, which roughly says that (1) the state is the same everywhere (2) the state allows continuous deformation.
				- There should be some better definition than A0 and A1. Perhaps local isomorphisms between different points?
		-
		- There is a natural embedding of sites $i_n$ from $D_n$ to $D_{n+1}$ preserving the topology.
			- $D_{n+1}$ can be viewed as the result of adding more sites to $D_n$ on the boundary.
			- However, for closed (more generally, non-sectorizable) manifolds there are not such good embeddings.
			  background-color:: red
				- Disks are worthy of studying, but closed manifolds should also be included.
		- Moreover, since $i_n$ is an embedding of sites, it induces an embedding of the Hom space $i_n: Hom(\mathcal H_n) \hookrightarrow Hom(\mathcal H_{n+1})$. (The notation $i$ has two meanings, which should be clear from the context.)
			-
		- Obviously we require $\rho_n$ to be consistent with $\rho_{n+1}$, which means that
		  $$\operatorname{Tr}_{D_{n+1} - D_n} (\rho_{n+1})  = \rho_n$$
			-
	- Definition. Direct limit of good disk states
		- The state $\rho^\infty = \lim_{n \to \infty} \rho_n$ defined on $\lim_{n \to \infty} Hom (\mathcal H_n)$, with each $\rho_n$ being good.
		-
-
	- Definition. Equivalence of direct limit of disk states
		- $\rho_1^\infty$ amd $\rho_2^\infty$ are called equivalent if they can be transformed to each other by LU and identifying/splitting sites.
- # Ideas
	- We have a natural product operation (tensor product). But does addition (direct sum) make sense?
		- For example, what is the direct sum of two toric codes?
	- ## Possible Generalizations
		- Asymptotically good states
			- Radius: The minimum radius of $\mu$-disks are $a \sqrt {R_n}$
				- This ensures both that the lower bound tends to infinity and the number of balls in a disk tends to infinity.
				- Note that it is inequivalent to merging several sites into one, since this form still allows balls to cross the 'merged' sites.
					- As a result, LU could still break A0 and A1 under this formalism.
			- Error: Good up to an error $e^{-k R_n}$
- # Possible Definitions of LU
	- Finitely generated many single-layer local unitaries
		- Definition. Single-layer local unitary
			- An unitary transformation  $U \in \lim_{n \to \infty} Hom (\mathcal H_n)$, such that there exists a maximal radius $r_0$, that $U$ is a tensor product of disjoint unitary operators with support within a disk of radius $r_0$.

	- Generated by exponentiating local Hamiltonians
		- Prop. The set of local Hamiltonians is a Lie algebra, i.e. a vector space closed under commutators.
- # Manifold and field theory
	- Replace density matrices by vn algebras is straightforward.
	- The problem is the notion of locality.
		- Could we learn from the definition and classification of TQFT?
