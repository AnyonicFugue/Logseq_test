# Principles
	- Motivation is very important.
		- I should not only take the efficiency into account, but also my motivation.
	- Balance understanding and long-term memory.

- # Problems
	- ## Note Taking
		- Handwriting or typing?
			-
-
- # Textbook Reading
	- ## Observations
		- I used to hope that I could reorganize the page three days later (as a method to incorporate recalling), but I find that repellent.
	- ## Workflow
		- Texts without explicit structures:
			- Read with Zotero or Sumatra
			- 在iPad上打草稿，写写画画。
				- Pro
					- This hugely boosts my understanding.
				- Todo
					- 不需要写得非常详细，因为我未来不会再看它了。
			- Record essential conclusions and understandings to Logseq.
				- Pro
					- Provide an overview
					- Easy reference
					- Note-taking itself is a pleasure as well as a process of review
				- Todo
					- First write down the main points and thoughts independently and leave things I cannot recall blank, then fill the formulae. Do **not** snip line by line. #card
					  card-last-interval:: 31.26
					  card-repeats:: 1
					  card-ease-factor:: 2.6
					  card-next-schedule:: 2023-09-09T18:49:55.559Z
					  card-last-reviewed:: 2023-08-09T12:49:55.560Z
					  card-last-score:: 5
						- This fits those subjects that I want to command soundly. Not for those exam subjects.
						- If I know how to derive it, I should be able to reproduce (or even improve) the result.
		-
		- Texts with explicit structures (Definition, theorem, etc. Mainly math books):
			- Record the definitions and theorems to Logseq by mathpix, but prove and ponder on iPad. 手写可以提供更多试验、发散思考的空间。
				- ((6451f87d-1304-416b-a4b4-7365e5c3ac9b)) Logseq helps long-term memory and iPad helps understanding.
- # Spaced Repetition
	- ## Observations
		- 超过10min后专注力就会显著下降，而且会感到厌恶。这对动机和兴趣是极大的磨损。
	- ## Workflow
		- 单次10min，在学习开始前来一次，学习结束后来一次。
		- The anki upper bound is modified to 60cards/day, but in one session it shall not exceed 30 cards.
