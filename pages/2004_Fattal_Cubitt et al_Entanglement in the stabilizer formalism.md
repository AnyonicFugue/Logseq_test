- Notes
	- He takes a different convention, i.e. taking logarithm wrt 2 rather than wrt e.
		- Under this convention the entropy of the Bell state is $\log_2 2=1$ rather than $\log_e 2=\ln 2$.
	- Here the author discusses a very special case, where all operator are generated by Paulis (i.e. only tensor products of Paulis, no linear combinations).
		- Therefore, $\operatorname{rank}G$ coincides with $n$, the number of qubits, to fix a unique stabilizer state.

- Try to generalize to general case

  collapsed:: true
	- $g\rho=\rho$ and $\rho^2=\rho$ still holds, therefore the density matrix still have only eigenvalues 0 and 1 and within the stabilizer space.
	- If the stabilizer state has dimension $k$, then $\operatorname{Tr}\rho=k$,
	  which means it is a (not normalized) equal-weight mix of the $k$ states.
	-
	- However, ((64b2d7a5-03fc-4db4-b894-699ecf6a1661)) is quite **special to Pauli operators**.
		- It even couldn't be expressed in the language of linear representations.
	-
	- Attempt: Try to modify the eigensystems of the stabilizers.

		- Idea
			- The stabilizer state is the common lowest eigenstate of all stabilizers.
			  Thus we are free to modify the stabilizers a bit, as long as the lowest eigenspace isn't changed.
			- e.g. Multiply by a scalar, find another set of generators, ...
		- Proposition. Invertible linear combinations preserve the lowest eigenspace.
			- First, if all components of a linear combination commute, then the lowest eigenspace must be within the lowest eigenspace of all components.
				- Note that we assumed the intersection of all lowest eigenspaces is nonempty, which is generally **not** true.
			- Thus *lowest eigenspace of stabilizers* includes *lowest eigenspace of linear combinations*
			- Invertibility guarantees the reverse inclusion.
