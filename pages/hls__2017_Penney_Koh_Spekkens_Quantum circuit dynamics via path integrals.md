- Here, one is given a modular description of the quantum system’s dynamics—for instance, a description of a quantum circuit with gates that are drawn from some fixed set of possibilities—and the goal is to compute the transition amplitudes of the overall circuit from a knowledge of the transition amplitudes of each gate.

- for discrete-time dynamics, can the phase S[γ] appearing in the path integral expression be understood as the action functional for a discrete-time path γ in a classical counterpart of the quantum circuit?

- In other words, the generating function of a symplectomorphism induced by Hamiltonian dynamics is exactly the action functional evaluated on the classical trajectories.

- What is special about quopit Clifford circuits is that they are known to admit a noncontextual hidden variable model, and this model provides the classical counterpart of the quantum dynamics

- The fact that cellular automata have a dynamical law that is similar to laws of physics in being both time-independent and spatially local, and the fact that many choices of this law yield dynamics having features that are strongly reminiscent of physics, including a fundamental limit to the speed of propagation of influences, the possibility of evolving stable structures and complex structures, and computational universality, has motivated many to pursue a reconstruction of physical theories in terms of them [19–21

- What is important for us is the functional form of the phase factor (action) because we seek to show that it can be interpreted as a generalised action functional through the theory of generating functions.
