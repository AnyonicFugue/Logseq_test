		- Let K be a subfield of a field F and let S be a subset of F.
		- The **subring** $K[S]$ of $F$ generated by $K \cup S$ is the set of all finite linear combinations with coefficients in $K$ of finite products of powers of elements of $S$.
		- The **subfield** $K(S)$ of $F$ generated by $K \cup S$ is the set of all $a b^{-1} \in F$ with $a, b \in K[S], b \neq 0$, and is isomorphic to the field of fractions of $K[S]$.
	- Composite
		- The composite $\prod_{i \in I} K_i$ of a nonempty family $\left(K_i\right)_{i \in I}$ of subfields of a field $F$ is **the subfield of $F$ generated** by $\bigcup_{i \in I} K_i$.
	- K-homomorphism
		- Let $K \subseteq E$ and $K \subseteq F$ be field extensions of $K$. A $K$-homomorphism of $E$ into $F$ is a field homomorphism $\varphi: E \longrightarrow F$ that is the identity on K.

		- Since each element has an inverse in a field, $x\in I \Rightarrow 1 \in I \Rightarrow I=K$
		- $Ker\ \phi$ is an ideal, which must be trivial since $\phi(1)=1$.

		- Corollary. If $\varphi: K \longrightarrow L$ is a field homomorphism, then $\operatorname{Im} \varphi$ is a subfield of $L$ and $K \cong \operatorname{Im} \varphi$.

			- Intuitively, we may **fully restore** $\alpha$ from $q=\operatorname{Irr}(\alpha: K)$ **and vice versa**.
			- Proof
				- E is a field
					- This is a bit interesting. We may prove it by polynomial division.
					- More generally, by III.8.3, $(q)$ is a maximal ideal of $K[X]$; hence $E=K[X] /(q)$ is a field.
				- $E=K(\alpha)$
					- $\alpha$ generates all 'polynomials modulo q'
				- $q=\operatorname{Irr}(\alpha: K)$ is obvious.
