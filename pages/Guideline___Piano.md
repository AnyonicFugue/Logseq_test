	- > If the bar is hard or unfamiliar, slow down to ensure correctness; if there is technical / musical improvement, think of it and write it down. If I need to practice the whole page to increase familiarity, allocate 3 to 5 minutes.
	  Be water and keep sober.
	- Select which hard points to attack. Specific attacks are much more fruitful.
		- Note that when new hard points emerge, **I can adjust my plan to attack the hard points concentratedly.**
		- But always be slow and ensure correctness.
	- Circle the hard points in LiquidText.

	- Keep things to practice **short**; attack a few bars concentratedly.
		- I may also devise some short 'etudes' (eg. Double notes)
	- Control my speed by metronome. Practice at **marginal speed** is the most efficient.
	- On the other hand, allow myself to play a big bunch sometimes; this fits my psychological need.

	- **Stand up immediately when the alarm goes off.**
	  Ger rid of low-efficiency time and embrace discomfort.
	- Record the new hard points to Liquidtext.
	- Reflect upon todays practice: Problems? Is my workflow efficient?
