- # To Be Understood
	- Single-Eigenstate limit
- # Comments
	- For localized systems, the properties cannot be captured by thermodynamical quantities (since they're only meaningful when the system is thermalized).
		- The major difference is dynamical.
- # Defs
	- MBL
		- Localization in highly excited states of strongly interacting many-body systems.
