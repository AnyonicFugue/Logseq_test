- What **collective quantum phenomena**, or dynamical phases of matter, can emerge using operations – such as unitary gates, measurements, and feedback – which are native to quantum simulators?

- A minimally-structured unitary quantum circuit which lacks any symmetries or other special properties will rapidly bring the system into a steady-state that is **locally completely disordered**, in the sense that local observables reproduce an infinite-temperature statistical ensemble.

- Instead, interesting universal features of the evolving state can be usefully quantified with **information-theoretic quantities** such as the entanglement entropy and the quantum mutual information, measures of correlations that are **non-linear** in the reduced density matrix for a subsystem.

- Monitored circuits, by contrast, show us that new dynamical universality classes are possible (even for dynamics with very little structure) once we step outside the domain of unitary evolution. In particular we focus on a phase transition, from an entangled to a disentangled phase, induced by monitoring (52, 53).

- Under the evolution, an arbitrary initial state (pure or mixed) eventually equilibrates locally to the Gibbs state (2). As there are no conserved quantities here, this is simply the featureless infinite temperature state
