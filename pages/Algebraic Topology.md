	- Reversing the arrow
		- In general a path might **not** go, thus is should be verified $x \in \operatorname{Im}f$.
			- For exact sequences, the latter step gives zero -> the former step could go.
		- Add $\operatorname{Ker}f$.
	- Paths can be freely deformed as long as they don't go backwards.
	-
	- For complexes, going along the same direction for two steps would give zero (since composition of two maps along the same direction would give zero).

			- An ordered set of points $\left\{p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_m\right\} \subset \mathbf{R}^n$ is affine independent if $\left\{p_1-p_0, p_2-p_0, \ldots, p_m-p_0\right\}$ is a linearly independent subset of the real vector space $\mathbf{R}^n$.
				- Intuitively, any vertex cannot be generated by other vertices (if we put $p_0$ at the origin).
				- 'In nondegenerate positions'.
			- Prop. The definition is independent of the 'base point' $p_0$
			- Examples
				- A set $\left\{p_0, p_1\right\}$ is affine independent if $p_1-p_0 \neq 0$, that is, if $p_1 \neq p_0$
				- A set $\left\{p_0, p_1, p_2\right\}$ is affine independent if it is not collinear
				- A set $\left\{p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3\right\}$ is affine independent if it is not coplanar.
		- In General position
			- A set of points $\left\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k\right\}$ in $\mathbf{R}^n$ is in general position if every $n+1$ of its points forms an affine independent set.

			- Let $\left\{p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_m\right\} \subset \mathbf{R}^n$ be affine independent and let $A$ denote the affine set it spans. An affine map $T: A \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^k$ (for some $k \geq 1$ ) is a function satisfying
			  $$
			  T\left(\sum t_j p_j\right)=\sum t_j T\left(p_j\right)
			  $$
			  whenever $\sum t_j=1$. The restriction of $T$ to $\left[p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_m\right]$ is also called an affine map.
			- Remarks

				- It is easier if I take a categorical viewpoint: induced maps are homs.
			- Key idea
				- A path $f$ in $X$ can be both $m_*(e_{x_0},f)$ and $m_*(f,e_{x_0})$ (H-space).
				- Moreover, the induced map is a homomorphism.
				- Therefore $f * g= m_*(e_{x_0},f) * m_*(g, e_{x_0})=m_*(g,f)=...=m_*(f,g)$ (Different components commute), which manifests the result.
			- Remark
				- It is a necessary condition that the fundamental group is abelian for the space to be a topological group.

		- If $f: \mathbf{I} \rightarrow X$ is a path from $x_0$ to $x_1$, call $x_0$ the origin of $f$ and write $x_0=\alpha(f)$; call $x_1$ the end of $f$ and write $x_1=\omega(f)$. A path $f$ in $X$ is closed at $x_0$ if $\alpha(f)=x_0=\omega(f)$
			- Observe that if $f$ and $g$ are paths with $f \simeq g$ rel \dot$\mathbf{I}$, then $\alpha(f)=\alpha(g)$ and $\omega(f)=\omega(g)$; therefore we may speak of the origin and end of a path class and write $\alpha[f]$ and $\omega[f]$.
		- If $p \in X$, then the constant function $i_p: \mathbf{I} \rightarrow X$ with $i_p(t)=p$ for all $t \in I$ is called the constant path at $p$.
