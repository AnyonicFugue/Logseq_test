	- Tensor products, unitors, braidings are naturally induced.

	- Is it 'the collection of all possible half-braidings of the objects'? #Problem
		- If not, he should have said '**a** drinfeld center' rather than '**the** drinfeld center'.
		- ((6376f533-10f8-4d2a-9437-0d43597d3bf8))
			- It seems that the Drinfeld center is the 'maximal central structure'.
- Example
	- The [[Toric Code]] is equivalent to $\mathfrak{Z}_1\left(\operatorname{Rep}\left(\mathbb{Z}_2\right)\right)$ and $\mathfrak{Z}_1\left(\operatorname{Vec}_{\mathbb Z_2}\right)$as braided fusion categories.

		- First find the left and right unitors in Vec.
		- [[Category]]
			- In categories (Grp, Vec) there is no 'element of a group / vector space'. We must express everything by **Homs**. That is, elements are images of certain Homs.
