	- What's the basic elements of intuition?
		- Extract patterns? Apply common and uncommon tricks? Rephrase the problem in as many ways as possible to create more connection?
			- They all seem plausible.
		- I think there are two levels.
			- On the microscopic level, I must be familiar with tricks and basic facts. Thus some fast derivation inside my head is possible.
			- On the macroscopic level, have some abstract principles in mind (hierarchical construction) to guide myself.
		- Compare to piano. We know many basic techniques, like scales, double notes, octaves.
	- How to train it efficiently?
		- Learning more is obviously necessary, but not the most efficient.
			- Like when practicing the piano, I shall surely learn lots of pieces, but specific and [[Deliberate Practice]] is more important.
