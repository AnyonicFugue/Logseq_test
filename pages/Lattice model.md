	- Local decomposition of the Hamiltonian.
	- What Hamiltonian can be called 'local'? Only adjacent sites? Range of interaction smaller than a given size? Only **finite** sites? #Problem
	-
	- Similarly: ((63686b20-ec87-494c-a7d5-0f70f513cbc9))m
		- Proposal: By equivalence classes of ground state wave functions [With ref]
- Example: ((63686b76-be61-478b-a8e2-378c8c78153d))
	- This is called 'trivial'. Physically intuitive(no interactions), but how to characterize mathematically? #Problem
