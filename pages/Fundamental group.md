		- This hints that the fundamental group doesn't depend on the points (on the same path component of X).
		  Moreover, $$\pi_1(C,x_0)=\pi_1(X,x_0)$$
		- Different path components are actually different 'objects'.

	- Homomorphism induced by a continuous map
		- Definition. Let $h .\left(X, x_0\right) \rightarrow\left(Y, y_0\right)$ be a continuous map. Define
		  $$
		  h_* : \pi_1\left(X, x_0\right) \longrightarrow \pi_1\left(Y, y_0\right)
		  $$
		  by $h_*([f])=[h \circ f]$
		- Note that $$h_*$$ doesn't depend on the representation element. #Exercise
		- Moreover, $$h_*$$ is a group homomorphism. #Exercise
	- If h is a homeomorphism, then $$h_*$$ is a group isomorphism.

			- By the [Theorem](((638c0f2d-33eb-4634-9467-e083bf50506d))), we may select a simply connected covering space. Here we choose R and covers $S^1$ in the usual way.
			- Let $e_0=0$. Now it's easy to see that the lifting correspondence $\phi$ is a group homomorphism.
