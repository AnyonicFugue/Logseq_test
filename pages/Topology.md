		- Lemma. #card
			- ((638de986-e9a0-45a2-bba8-d698da5b3ed1)) Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an open covering of the metric space $(X, d)$. If $X$ is compact, there is a $\delta>0$ such that for each subset of $X$ having diameter less than $\delta$, there exists an element of $\mathcal{A}$ **containing** it.
			  The number $\delta$ is called a Lebesgue number for the covering $\mathcal{A}$.
				- This grants some convenient constructions.
			- Intuition
				- It suffices to consider connected X.
				- The open sets must intersect to cover X. Moreover, the intersection can't be infinitely small.
			- Proof
				- Construct a function $f(x)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n d\left(x, C_i\right)$, where $C_i=X-O_i$. #Trick
					- i.e. The distance to the boundary.
					- The trick of constructing a function is remarkable
				- Since $x$ is in some $O_i$, the distance must be greater than zero.
				- f is continuous, X is compact -> f has a minimum $\delta$, which is our required number.
