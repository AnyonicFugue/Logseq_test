			- A directed set $J$ is a set with a partial order $\preceq$ such that for 
			  each pair $\alpha, \beta$ of elements of $J$, there exists an element $\gamma$ of $J$ having the property that $\alpha \preceq \gamma$ and $\beta \preceq \gamma$

		- Def
			- A net in $X$ is a function $f$ from a directed set $J$ into $X$.
			- We usually denote $f(\alpha)$ by $x_\alpha$. We denote the net $f$ itself by the symbol $\left(x_\alpha\right)_{\alpha \in J}$, or merely by $\left(x_\alpha\right)$.
		-
		- The net $\left(x_\alpha\right)$ is said to **converge** to the point $x$ of $X$ (wntten $\left.x_\alpha \rightarrow x\right)$ if for each neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there exists $\alpha \in J$ such that $$\alpha \leq \beta \Longrightarrow x_\beta \in U .$$
		  This shows that nets are **natural generalizations of sequences!**
		-
		- Net is an equivalent way to define a topology which is easily categorified.  #Remark
	- Theorems about nets
		- If X is [[Hausdorff ]], a net in X converges to at most one point.
		- Let $f: X \rightarrow Y$. Then $f$ is [[Continuous]] if and only if for every convergent net $\left(x_\alpha\right)$ in $X$, converging to $x$, say, the net $\left(f\left(x_\alpha\right)\right)$ converges to $f(x)$.

			- Definition
				- Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces; let $p: X \rightarrow Y$ be a surjective map. 
				  The map $p$ is said to be a quotient map provided a subset $U$ of $Y$ is open in $Y$ if and only if $p^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$.
				- "Quotient" means "Identifying points in X mapped to same Y".
					- eg Quotient group
			-
			- Theorem 22.1. Let $p: X \rightarrow Y$ be a quotient map; let $A$ be a subspace of $X$ that is saturated with respect to $p$; let $q: A \rightarrow p(A)$ be the map obtained by restricting $p$.
				- (1) If $A$ is either open or closed in $X$, then $q$ is a quotient map.
				- (2) If $p$ is either an open map or a closed map, then $q$ is a quotient map.

				- (b) (**Inclusion**) If $A$ is a subspace of $X$, the inclusion function $j:A\rightarrow X$ is continuous.
				- (c) (**Composites**) If $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and $g:Y\rightarrow Z$ are continuous, then the map $g$ o $f:X\rightarrow Z$ is continuous.
				- (d) (**Restrcting the domain**) If $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous, and if $A$ is a subspace of $X$, then the restricted function $f\mid A\cdot A\rightarrow Y$ is continuous.
				- (e) (**Restricting or expanding the rang**e) Let $f\cdot X\rightarrow Y$ be continuous. If $Z$ is a subspace of $Y$ containing the image set $f(X)$, then the function $g:X\rightarrow Z$ obtained by restricting the range of $f$ is contunuous. If $Z$ is a space having $Y$ as a subspace, then the function $h:X\rightarrow Z$ obtained by expanding the range of $f$ is continuous.

	- Lemma (The Lebesgue number lemma). Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an open covering of the metric space $(X, d)$. If $X$ is Compact, there is a Lebesgue number $\delta>0$. #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- Intuitively, this theorem states that 'the open covering must have a nonzero **overlapping**'
		-
		- **Proof**:
		- Simplify: We may only consider a finite covering A and open disks as subsets to be contained.
		- Use contrapositive. Set $\delta_n=1/n$. We have a series of disks $D_n:=D(x_n,r_n)$, where $r_n<\delta_n$.
		- Compact ⇒ [[Limit point compact]], so the sequence $(x_n)$ has a convergent subsequence.
		- Denote the limit point as $y$. Some $D(y,\epsilon)$ must lie within some $A$.
		- This A must contain some $D_n$, since $r_n$ vanishes. This leads to a contradiction.
		-
		- **Official proof**: Construct a distance function.
		- Let $C_i=X-A_i$, $f(x)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n d\left(x, C_i\right)$.
		- Easy to see $f(x)>0$ for all x.
		- Since x is continuous, it has a minimum. Denote it as $\delta$.
		- Easy to see this is our required Lebesgue number.

	- ## One-point Compactification
		- Motivation
			- Two of the best properties of a topological space are **compact** and **Hausdorff**.
			  We'd like to ask the problem: Under what circumstances would a subspace inherit these properties?
		- Def #card
			- X is a subspace of Y
			- $Y-X$ is a single point
			- Y is compact Hausdorff
			- Moreover, two compactifications are said to be homeomorphic with a homeomorphism acting as an identity on X.
		- Theorem. $X$ is Locally compact [[Hausdorff]] if and only if $X$ has a one-point compactification.  #card
			- q⇒p: Easier.
			  Hausdorff is obvious. Just prove local compactness.
			- Suppose $Y-X={z}$. Consider some point $x\in X$. Since Y is Hausdorff, we can find disjoint $U(x,z)$ and $U(z,x)$.
			- The closure of $U(x,z)$ is closed in Y, thus compact.
			  Moreover, since $U(x,z)$ and $U(z,x)$ are disjoint,  $\over {U(x,z)}$ and $U(z,x)$ are disjoint.
			-
			- p⇒q: We need to construct the topology of Y.
			- When proving q⇒p, we noticed that In Compact Hausdorff spaces, Closed ⇔ Compact.
			- Thus {$O(z)\in \mathscr T(Y)$} ⇔ $Y-O(z)$ closed and compact in Y ⇔ $Y-O(z)$ compact in X. 
			  So the topology of Y shall be $\mathscr T(X) \cup \{Y-C|C\ compact\ in\ X\}$
			- The rest is verifying it's indeed a topology, X has subspace topology, Y is compact.
			-
			- Remark: If X isn't compact, then z is a Limit point of X, which is quite interesting!
		- Corollary. For [[Hausdorff ]] $X$ Locally compact ⇔ For $x$ in $X$ and a neighborhood $U(x)$, there is a neighborhood $V$(x) such that $\bar{V}$ is compact and $\bar{V} \subset U$  #card
			- q⇒p: $\bar V$ serves as the compact subset.
			- p⇒q: We may use the 1-point compactification.
			- The rest is easy: Hausdorff ⇒ $Y-U(x)$ compact ⇒ We may find disjoint open sets covering $Y-U(x)$ and $U(x)$.
			  The open set containing $U(x)$ is the desired $V(x)$. $V\cap U=\empty$ ⇒ $\bar V \cap U=\empty$
			- Strategy: ((63c1416f-d51b-4487-865b-f9d3cf9b5918))
		- Corollary. If X is loc. comp. Haus, A is closed or open in X, then A is Locally compact Hausdorff.

	- Defs
		- Define $\pi_0(X)$ to be the set of path components of $X$. If $f: X \rightarrow Y$, define $\pi_0(f): \pi_0(X) \rightarrow \pi_0(Y)$ to be the function taking a path component $C$ of $X$ to the (unique) path component of $Y$ containing $f(C)$.
			- ((6427f2e4-0f92-4d71-9056-c205ac7f7736)) $\pi_0: \mathrm{Top} \rightarrow \mathrm{Set}$ is a functor. Moreover, if $f \simeq g$, then $\pi_0(f)=$ $\pi_0(g)$ #card
				- It maps a continuous map to a map between path components (Exercise: Verify the map between path components is well-defined).
				  It suffices to verify that the morphisms compose properly to show it is a functor.
				-
				- Corollary. If $X$ and $Y$ have the same homotopy type, then they have the same number of path components.

			- For each $x \in X$ and every open neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there is an open $V$ with $x \in V \subset U$ such that any two points in $V$ can be joined by a path in $U$.
			- Intuition
				- Note that this doesn't mean each $x$ has a connected small neighborhood, because $V$ itself may not be path connected. 
				  It's that points in $V$ can be joined by paths in $U.
			- ((642be6d7-d592-4d6e-9bed-7e9e0d6624dc)) A space $X$ is locally path connected if and only if path components of open subsets are open. In particular, if $X$ is locally path connected, then its path components are open.

				- p -> q:
					- It's easy to see $U=\cup_x V(x)$.
						- $V(x)$ is in a single component.
						- Openness of $U$ grants such a $V(x)$ exists.
				- q -> p:
					- The path components of $U$ are open. Just take the one containing $x$.
	- Basic facts
		- Corollary. For $x$ locally path-connected, the components of open subsets coincide with path components. #card

			- Component -> Same path component:
				- Suppose $C$ has two path components $P_1$ and $P_2$. Then by the theorem above they're both open, which contradicts that $C$ is a component.
			- Path component -> Same component:
				- This holds in any topo space.
