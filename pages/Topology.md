			- A directed set $J$ is a set with a partial order $\preceq$ such that for 
			  each pair $\alpha, \beta$ of elements of $J$, there exists an element $\gamma$ of $J$ having the property that $\alpha \preceq \gamma$ and $\beta \preceq \gamma$
				- Exist larger elements not for single elements, but also for **pairs**!

		- Def
			- A net in $X$ is a function $f$ from a directed set $J$ into $X$.
			- We usually denote $f(\alpha)$ by $x_\alpha$. We denote the net $f$ itself by the symbol $\left(x_\alpha\right)_{\alpha \in J}$, or merely by $\left(x_\alpha\right)$.
		-
		- The net $\left(x_\alpha\right)$ is said to **converge** to the point $x$ of $X$ (wntten $\left.x_\alpha \rightarrow x\right)$ if for each neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there exists $\alpha \in J$ such that $$\alpha \leq \beta \Longrightarrow x_\beta \in U .$$
		  This shows that nets are **natural generalizations of sequences!**
		-
		- Net is an equivalent way to define a topology which is easily categorified.  #Remark
	- Theorems about nets
		- If X is [[Hausdorff ]], a net in X converges to at most one point.
		- Let $f: X \rightarrow Y$. Then $f$ is [[Continuous]] if and only if for every convergent net $\left(x_\alpha\right)$ in $X$, converging to $x$, say, the net $\left(f\left(x_\alpha\right)\right)$ converges to $f(x)$.
		- X is compact if and only if every net in X has a convergent subnet.

			- Definition
				- Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces; let $p: X \rightarrow Y$ be a surjective map. 
				  The map $p$ is said to be a quotient map provided a subset $U$ of $Y$ is open in $Y$ if and only if $p^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$.
				- "Quotient" means "Identifying points in X mapped to same Y".
					- eg Quotient group
			-
			- Theorem 22.1. Let $p: X \rightarrow Y$ be a quotient map; let $A$ be a subspace of $X$ that is saturated with respect to $p$; let $q: A \rightarrow p(A)$ be the map obtained by restricting $p$.
				- (1) If $A$ is either open or closed in $X$, then $q$ is a quotient map.
				- (2) If $p$ is either an open map or a closed map, then $q$ is a quotient map.

				- (c) (**Composites**) If $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and $g:Y\rightarrow Z$ are continuous, then the map $g$ o $f:X\rightarrow Z$ is continuous.
				- (d) (**Restrcting the domain**) If $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous, and if $A$ is a subspace of $X$, then the restricted function $f\mid A\cdot A\rightarrow Y$ is continuous.
				- (e) (**Restricting or expanding the rang**e) Let $f\cdot X\rightarrow Y$ be continuous. If $Z$ is a subspace of $Y$ containing the image set $f(X)$, then the function $g:X\rightarrow Z$ obtained by restricting the range of $f$ is contunuous. If $Z$ is a space having $Y$ as a subspace, then the function $h:X\rightarrow Z$ obtained by expanding the range of $f$ is continuous.
				- (f) (**Local formulation of continuity**) The map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous if $X$ can be written as the union of open sets $U_{\alpha }$ such that $f\mid U_{\alpha }$ is continuous for each $\alpha$.

			- Intuition
				- The metric space is bounded, i.e. we cannot construct a sequence extending to infinity.
			- Proof of the hard part, i.e. LPC -> Compact
				- First, we show that if $X$ is sequentially compact, then the **Lebesgue number lemma** holds for $X$.
				  collapsed:: true
					- Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an open covering of $X$. We assume that there is **no** $\delta>0$ such that each set of diameter less than $\delta$ has an element of $\mathcal{A}$ containing it, and derive a contradiction.
					- Our assumption implies in particular that for each positive integer $n$, there exists a set of diameter less than $1 / n$ that is not contained in any element of let $C_n$ be such a set.
					- Choose a point $x_n \in C_n$, for each $n$.
					- By hypothesis, some subsequence $\left(x_{n_i}\right)$ of the sequence $\left(x_n\right)$ converges, say to the point $a$. Now $a$ belongs to some element $A$ of the collection $\mathcal{A}$; because $A$ is open, we may choose an $\epsilon>0$ such that $B(a, \epsilon) \subset A$. If $i$ is large enough that $1 / n_i<\epsilon / 2$, then the set $C_{n_1}$ lies in the $\epsilon / 2$-neighborhood of $x_{n_1}$; if $i$ is also chosen large enough that $d\left(x_{n_1}, a\right)<\epsilon / 2$, then $C_{n_1}$ lies in the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $a$.
					- But this means that $C_{n_1} \subset A$, contrary to hypothesis.
				- Second, we show that if $X$ is sequentially compact, then given $\epsilon>0$, there exists a finite covering of $X$ by open $\epsilon$-balls.
				  collapsed:: true
					- Once again, we proceed by contradiction. Assume that there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that $X$ cannot be covered by finitely many $\epsilon$-balls.
					- Construct a sequence of points $x_n$ of $X$ as follows: First, choose $x_1$ to be any point of $X$. Noting that the ball $B\left(x_1, \epsilon\right)$ is not all of $X$ (otherwise $X$ could be covered by a single $\epsilon$-ball), choose $x_2$ to be a point of $X$ not in $B\left(x_1, \epsilon\right)$. In general, given $x_1, \ldots, x_n$, choose $x_{n+1}$ to be a point not in the union
					  $$
					  B\left(x_1, \epsilon\right) \cup \cdots \cup B\left(x_n, \epsilon\right),
					  $$
					  using the fact that these balls do not cover $X$.
					- Note that by construction $d\left(x_{n+1}, x_i\right) \geq$ $\epsilon$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$. Therefore, the sequence $\left(x_n\right)$ can have no convergent subsequence, which is a contraction.
				- Finally we use the above two together: First obtain a Lebesgue number $\delta$, then choose a finite covering by $\delta/3$-balls.
				  Then each ball is contained by some $A \in \mathcal A$, which gives a finite subcover of $\mathcal A$.
			- What makes the proof work?
				- The lebesgue number provides a quantification of the open sets.
				  Therefore it's easier to construct a sequence of open sets (and corresponding points) that could never converge.
				- What is the Lebesgue number? What properties does it use?
				  background-color:: red
					- It uses a mapping from the open sets to $\mathbb R$ by taking the radius.
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- It provides a partial order quantified by the 'lower bound of radius'.
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- Moreover, convergence is (almost) defined by the same map.

			- Two of the best properties of a topological space are **compact** and **Hausdorff**.
			  We'd like to ask the problem: Under what circumstances would a subspace inherit these properties?

				- $X \sub Y$ and $Y-X$ is a single point, while $Y$ is compact Hausdorff.
				- Moreover, two compactifications are said to be homeomorphic with a homeomorphism acting as an identity on $X$.
				- Explicitly: The topology of Y is $\mathscr T_Y = \mathscr T_X \cup \{Y-C|C\ compact\ in\ X\}$
					- For $\mathbb R^n$, the second part is '$\infty$ plus complement of closed bounded set'
		-
		- The main theorem. $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff if and only if $X$ has a one-point compactification.

			- q⇒p: Easier.
				- Hausdorff is obvious, since any subspace of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff.
					- Suppose $Y-X={z}$. Consider some point $x\in X$. Since Y is Hausdorff, we can find disjoint $U(x,z)$ and $U(z,x)$.
				- Local compactness
					- The closure of $U(x,z)$ is closed in Y, thus compact.
					  Moreover, since $U(x,z)$ and $U(z,x)$ are disjoint,  $\over {U(x,z)}$ and $U(z,x)$ are disjoint.
			-
			- p⇒q: We need to construct the topology of Y.
				- When proving q⇒p, we noticed that In Compact Hausdorff spaces, Closed ⇔ Compact.
				- Thus $O(z)\in \mathscr T(Y)$ ⇔ $Y-O(z)$ closed and compact in Y ⇔ $Y-O(z)$ compact in X. 
				  So the topology of Y shall be $\mathscr T(X) \cup \{Y-C|C\ compact\ in\ X\}$
				- The rest is verifying it's indeed a topology, X has subspace topology, Y is compact.
			-
			- Remark: If X isn't compact, then z is a Limit point of X, which is quite interesting!

		- Corollary. For Hausdorff $X$, Locally compact ⇔ For $x$ in $X$ and a neighborhood $U(x)$, there is a neighborhood $V$(x) such that $\bar{V}$ is compact and $\bar{V} \subset U$

			- q ⇒ p: $\bar V$ serves as the compact subset.
			- p ⇒ q: We may use the 1-point compactification.
			- The rest is easy: Hausdorff ⇒ $Y-U(x)$ compact ⇒ We may find disjoint open sets covering $Y-U(x)$ and $U(x)$.
			  The open set containing $U(x)$ is the desired $V(x)$. $V\cap U=\empty$ ⇒ $\bar V \cap U=\empty$

		- Corollary. If X is loc. comp. Haus, A is closed or open in X, then A is Locally compact Hausdorff.

		- Def
			- For each pair $x_{1} ,x_{2}$ of distinct points of $X$, there exist neighborhoods $U_{1}$, and $U_{2}$ of $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, respectively, that are disjoint.

			- For each $x \in X$ and every open neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there is an open $V$ with $x \in V \subset U$ such that any two points in $V$ can be joined by a path in $U$.
			- Intuition
				- Note that this doesn't mean each $x$ has a connected small neighborhood, because $V$ itself may not be path connected. 
				  It's that points in $V$ can be joined by paths in $U$.
			- ((642be6d7-d592-4d6e-9bed-7e9e0d6624dc)) A space $X$ is locally path connected if and only if path components of open subsets are open. In particular, if $X$ is locally path connected, then its path components are open.

			- Component -> Same path component:
				- Suppose $C$ has two path components $P_1$ and $P_2$. Then by the theorem above they're both open, which contradicts that $C$ is a component.
