			- ((638de986-e9a0-45a2-bba8-d698da5b3ed1)) Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an open covering of the metric space $(X, d)$. If $X$ is compact, there is a $\delta>0$ such that for each subset of $X$ having diameter less than $\delta$, there exists an element of $\mathcal{A}$ **containing** it.
			  The number $\delta$ is called a Lebesgue number for the covering $\mathcal{A}$.
				- This grants some convenient constructions. Essentially, we have a lower bound for the 'lengths'.
					- We may divide an interval into finite pieces.
			- Intuition
				- It suffices to consider connected X.
				- The open sets must intersect to cover X. Moreover, the intersection can't be infinitely small.
			- Proof
				- Construct a function $f(x)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n d\left(x, C_i\right)$, where $C_i=X-O_i$. #Trick
					- i.e. The distance to the boundary.
					- The trick of constructing a function is remarkable
				- Since $x$ is in some $O_i$, the distance must be greater than zero.
				- f is continuous, X is compact -> f has a minimum $\delta$, which is our required number.

	- Directed set #card
		- Def
			- A directed set $J$ is a set with a partial order $\preceq$ such that for 
			  each pair $\alpha, \beta$ of elements of $J$, there exists an element $\gamma$ of $J$ having the property that $\alpha \preceq \gamma$ and $\beta \preceq \gamma$
			- A subset $K$ of $J$ is said to be **cofinal** in $J$ if for each $\alpha \in J$, there exists $\beta \in K$ such that $\alpha \preceq \beta$.
			-
		- This is a generalization of sequences: always 'later' terms.

		- Def
			- A net in $X$ is a function $f$ from a directed set $J$ into $X$.
			- We usually denote $f(\alpha)$ by $x_\alpha$. We denote the net $f$ itself by the symbol $\left(x_\alpha\right)_{\alpha \in J}$, or merely by $\left(x_\alpha\right)$.
		-
		- The net $\left(x_\alpha\right)$ is said to **converge** to the point $x$ of $X$ (wntten $\left.x_\alpha \rightarrow x\right)$ if for each neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there exists $\alpha \in J$ such that $$\alpha \leq \beta \Longrightarrow x_\beta \in U .$$
		  This shows that nets are **natural generalizations of sequences!**
		-
		- Net is an equivalent way to define a topology which is easily categorified.  #Remark
	- Theorems about nets
		- If X is [[Hausdorff ]], a net in X converges to at most one point.
		- Let $f: X \rightarrow Y$. Then $f$ is [[Continuous]] if and only if for every convergent net $\left(x_\alpha\right)$ in $X$, converging to $x$, say, the net $\left(f\left(x_\alpha\right)\right)$ converges to $f(x)$.
		- X is compact if and only if every net in X has a convergent subnet.

	- Topology
		- A topology on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $X$ having the following properties:
		-
		- (1) $\emptyset$ and $X$ are in $\mathcal{T}$.
		- (2) The union of the elements of any subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.
		- (3) The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.

		- If $X$ is a set, a basis for a topology on $X$ is a collection $\mathscr{B}$ of subsets of $X$ (called basis elements) such that 
		  (1) For each $x\in X$, there is at least one basis element $B$ containing $x$.
		  (2) If $x$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$, then there is a basis element $B_{3}$ containing $x$ such that $B_{3} \subset B_{1} \cap B_{2}$.
		-
		- The topology generated by $\mathscr{B}$  is all **unions of elements** of $\mathscr{B}$.
	-
	- Subbasis #card
		- A subbasis $\delta$ for a topology on $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ whose union equals $X$.
		- The topology generated by the subbasis $\delta$ is defined to be the collection $\mathcal{T}$ of all **unions of finite intersections** of elements of $\delta$.

		- Def
			- Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. The product topology on $X\times Y$ is the topology having as [[Basis]] the collection $\mathscr{B}$ of all sets of the form $U\times V$, where $\underline{U}$ is an open subset of $X$ and $V$ is an open subset of $Y$.
		-
		- Theorem 18.4 (Maps into products). Let $f:A\rightarrow X\times Y$ be given by the equation ([[Coordinate functions]])
		  $$f(a)=f_1(a) \times f_2(a)$$ 
		  Then $f$ is [[Continuous]] if and only if the functions$$f_{1} : A\longrightarrow X\ \ \text{ and } \ \ f_{2} :A\longrightarrow Y$$are continuous.
			- In [[Tensor product]], we also construct [[Coordinate functions]] to prove things.

	- Subspace topology
		- Let $X$ be a topological space with topology  $\mathcal{T}$. If  $Y$ is a subset of  $X$, the collection $$\mathcal{T}_{Y} =\{Y\cap U\mid U\in \mathcal{T} \}$$ is a topology on $Y$, called the subspace topology.
		- With this topology, $Y$ is called a subspace of $X$; its open sets consist of all intersections of open sets of X with $Y$
	-
	- Closed
		- A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be closed if the set $X-A$ is open.
		-
		- Theorem 17.1. Let $X$ be a topological space. Then the following conditions hold:
			- (1) $\emptyset$ and $X$ are closed.
			- (2) Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed.
			- (3) Finite unions of closed sets are closed.

	- Interior
		- the union of all open sets contained in $A$
	-
	- Closure
		- the intersection of all [[Closed]] sets containing $A$.
		-
		- the closure of $A$ in $Y$ equals $\overline{A} \cap Y$.

		- Def
			- For each pair $x_{1} ,x_{2}$ of distinct points of $X$, there exist neighborhoods $U_{1}$, and $U_{2}$ of $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, respectively, that are disjoint.
		-
		- Theorem 17.8. Every finite point set in a Hausdorff space $X$ is [[Closed]].  (T2 implies T1)
		- Theorem 17.10. A sequence of points of $X$ converges to at most one point of $X$

			- A function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is said to be continuous if for each open subset $V$ of $Y$, the set $f^{-1} (V)$ is an [[Open]subset of $X$.

			- (1) $f$ is continuous.
			- (2) For every closed set $B$ of $Y$, the set $f^{-1} (B)$ is closed in $X$
			- (3) For every subset $A$ of $X$, one has $f(\overline{A} )\subset \overline{f(A)}$.
			- (4) For each $x\in X$ and each neighborhood $V$ of $f(x)$, there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $f(U)\subset V$.
				- If the condition in (4) holds for the point $x$ of $X$, we say that $f$ is continuous at the point $x$.
				-
		- Theorem $18.2$ (Rules for constructing continuous functions). Let $X,Y$, and $Z$ be topological spaces.
			- (a) (**Constant function**) If $f.X\rightarrow Y$ maps all of $X$ into the single point $y_{o}$ of $Y$, then $f$ is continuous.
			- (b) (**Inclusion**) If $A$ is a subspace of $X$, the inclusion function $j:A\rightarrow X$ is continuous.
			- (c) (**Composites**) If $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and $g:Y\rightarrow Z$ are continuous, then the map $g$ o $f:X\rightarrow Z$ is continuous.
			- (d) (**Restrcting the domain**) If $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous, and if $A$ is a subspace of $X$, then the restricted function $f\mid A\cdot A\rightarrow Y$ is continuous.
			- (e) (**Restricting or expanding the rang**e) Let $f\cdot X\rightarrow Y$ be continuous. If $Z$ is a subspace of $Y$ containing the image set $f(X)$, then the function $g:X\rightarrow Z$ obtained by restricting the range of $f$ is contunuous. If $Z$ is a space having $Y$ as a subspace, then the function $h:X\rightarrow Z$ obtained by expanding the range of $f$ is continuous.
			- (f) (**Local formulation of continuity**) The map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous if $X$ can be written as the union of open sets $U_{\alpha }$ such that $f\mid U_{\alpha }$ is continuous for each $\alpha$.

		- Definition
			- Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces; let $p: X \rightarrow Y$ be a surjective map. 
			  The map $p$ is said to be a quotient map provided a subset $U$ of $Y$ is open in $Y$ if and only if $p^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$.
			- "Quotient" means "Identifying points in X mapped to same Y".
				- eg Quotient group
		-
		- Theorem 22.1. Let $p: X \rightarrow Y$ be a quotient map; let $A$ be a subspace of $X$ that is saturated with respect to $p$; let $q: A \rightarrow p(A)$ be the map obtained by restricting $p$.
			- (1) If $A$ is either open or closed in $X$, then $q$ is a quotient map.
			- (2) If $p$ is either an open map or a closed map, then $q$ is a quotient map.
		-
		- More Properties:
			- Composites of maps behave nicely.
			- Products of maps do not behave well; the cartesian product of two quotient maps need not be a quotient map
			- the [[Hausdorff ]] condition does not behave well.
