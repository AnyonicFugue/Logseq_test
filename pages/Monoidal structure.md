alias:: [[Fusion]], Monoidal Category

-
- # Defs
  collapsed:: true
	- ((636dff04-0f30-41b4-bb8a-18ae5952d6c5))
	  A fusion map, unitality of vacuum, and some consistency relations.
	-
	- Monoidal functor
		- Physical intuitions
			- 'Map and fuse' shall be isomorphic to 'fuse and map'
				- ((6376e69f-4dbd-4465-b405-49950dce1124))
	- Note that the structure is more than a [[tensor product]]. The tensor product only gives the [[Fusion rules]] , but the **associators** are absent.
		- Can be always extend a set of [[Fusion rules]] into a monoidal structure?
			- NO. Sometimes there are no solutions to the associators.
- The real physical story is much richer. [[Topological Order]]
  collapsed:: true
	- In a physical realization, particles at different sites must be linked by adiabatic moves.

	- ((636e0028-6f43-42ef-b78c-41ff562460e6))
		- Kong called it 'the most of important physical properties of a topo order'.
			- How to prove this? How to rephrase the property for gapless phases, where adiabatic moves aren't defined? #[[Open problem]]

- # Properties
	- Theorem. Each monoidal category is equivalent to a strict monoidal category. #card
	  card-last-interval:: 26.06
	  card-repeats:: 1
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.6
	  card-next-schedule:: 2023-04-21T08:55:51.485Z
	  card-last-reviewed:: 2023-03-26T07:55:51.485Z
	  card-last-score:: 5
		- 'Strict' means that all associators are identity.

	  collapsed:: true
		- ((636e07c8-8de8-40a2-9ace-ad0e0248d95d))
		- Linked to [[Group Cohomology]]!
	- Exercise. The left dual of $G\in \mathrm{End}(\mathcal{C})$ is the left adjoint of G.
