alias:: Fusion

- Definition
	- ((636dff04-0f30-41b4-bb8a-18ae5952d6c5))
	  A fusion map, triviality of vacuum, and some consistency relations.
	- Note that the structure is more than a [[tensor product]]. The tensor product only gives the [[Fusion rules]] , but the **associators** are absent.
		- Can be always extend a [[tensor product]] into a monoidal structure? #Problem
- The real physical story is much richer. [[Topological Order]]
  collapsed:: true
	- In a physical realization, particles at different sites must be linked by adiabatic moves.

		- Kong called it 'the most of important physical properties of a topo order'.
			- How to prove this? How to rephrase the property for gapless phases, where adiabatic moves aren't defined? #[[Open problem]]
