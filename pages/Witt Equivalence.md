alias:: Witt equivalent

- Def #card
	- ((63a6b763-d79b-49fa-a285-b530384b965a)) We say that two anomaly-free stable 2d topological orders C and D are Witt equivalent if there **exists a gapped 1d domain wall between them**.
	- Mathematically: We say that two nondegenerate braided fusion categories $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ are Witt equivalent if there exists a closed fusion $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D})$-bimodule $\mathcal{M}$.
- Relation with [[Stacking]]
	- Physically, if $\mathrm{M}$ is a domain wall between $\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{D}$, and $\mathrm{M}^{\prime}$ is a domain wall between $\mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ and $\mathrm{D}^{\prime}$, then $\mathrm{M} \otimes \mathrm{M}^{\prime}$ is a domain wall between $C \otimes C^{\prime}$ and $D \otimes D^{\prime}$
	- So the stacking operation defines a **multiplication** on the set of Witt equivalence classes of anomaly-free stable $2D$ topological orders.

		- There is a unit $1_2$.
		- Moreover, the multiplication is commutative.
		- Thus it forms the Witt group, an abelian group.
