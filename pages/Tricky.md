- Multi-value problem
	- The typical case is the square root.
		- For example, in ((64e4c247-88fb-4f65-a2dc-612c882c026d)) of Kitaev honeycomb, we have
		  $$a_{\pm } =\pm \sqrt{\frac{x^{*}}{x}} \\
		  \lambda_{\pm} = a_{\pm} x$$
		  but we cannot pull $x$ into the square root and write 
		  $$\lambda_{\pm}=\pm \sqrt{x^*x}$$.
		- The problem is that $\sqrt{x^2}$ is multi-valued and $\sqrt{x^2} \neq x$, so pulling $x$ in and out of the square root is problematic.
			- However, there is a weaker multi-value problem with $\sqrt{x^4}$, so it's OK to pull out $x^2$.
