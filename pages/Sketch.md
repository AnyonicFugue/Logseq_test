		- Possible simplifications
			- $k<<p$
			- The magnitude, and thus the energy, of k are fixed. Only integrate over the solid angle.
				- Thus we can separate $k_0$.
				- This is still a 2D integration. Of course we shall reduce one variable.
			- Lorentz invariance -> Select a convenient frame eg. Center-of-mass.
			  background-color:: red
			  collapsed:: true
				- More generally, any spatial momenta can be made zero. 4-momenta, however, transforms covariantly.
				- * Here the frame seems to be fixed; we have to integrate over k.
