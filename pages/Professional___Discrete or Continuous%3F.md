- # Questions
	- Is [[Time]] discrete?
		- Classical: Cellular automata
			- ((63e35566-f9ac-4198-b153-0dbf4a564608))
		- Quantum: Spectrums of observables are discrete. What about time itself?
	- Is the number of d.o.f. discrete?
		- eg. Quantum circuit dynamics
		- It is not in [[QFT]] on $R^4$.
		- But what if the space, or the [[Spacetime]] manifold, is compact?
		- Even more, what if time, or spacetime, is discrete?
	- ### Ideas and Projects
		- Extend Lagrangian mechanics to the discrete case via algebraic geometry.
		- Lots of great ideas in [[2017_Penney_Koh_Spekkens_Quantum circuit dynamics via path integrals]].
- # Links Between the Two
	- The first hint is of course the [[Gamma Function]], which extends the factorial to $\mathbb C$.
		- Moreover, vast interesting structures follows. The link to [[Zeta Function]] and analytical number theory is the most prominent.
		- It is used (without awareness) in [[Dimensional Regularization]].
	- A huge hint comes from algebraic geometry, which generalizes lots of things to finite fields (which can be comprehended as 'discrete').
