  collapsed:: true
  Let $H$ be a group, and let $$\phi_1: \pi_1\left(U, x_0\right) \longrightarrow H \quad \text { and } \quad \phi_2: \pi_1\left(V, x_0\right) \longrightarrow H$$ be homomorphisms. 
  ((63d8c1ea-a5a1-4c97-b296-2496217fccb9))
  If $\phi_1 \circ i_1=\phi_2 \circ i_2$, then there exists a unique homomorphism $\Phi: \pi_1\left(X, x_0\right) \rightarrow H$ such that $\Phi \circ j_1=\phi_1$ and $\Phi \circ j_2=\phi_2$. #card
	- Plain English
		- This theorem says that if $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are arbitrary homomorphisms that are "**compatible** on $U \cap V$," then they induce a homomorphism of $\pi_1\left(X, x_0\right)$ into $H$.
	- Intuition
		- First, since $U\cap V$ is path-connected, $\pi_1(X)$ can be generated by $\pi_1(U)$ and $\pi_1(V)$.
		- 'Compatible' grants that we can obtain $\Phi$ by 'gluing' $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, i.e. $\Phi(g)=\phi_1(a_1)\phi_2(b_1)...\phi_1(a_n)\phi_2(b_n)$
		- Composition property is manifest. It remains to check $\Phi$ is well defined, which is equivalent to mapping e to e.
		- Q: When do we obtain trivial loops?
		  background-color:: purple
			- As in the proof of 'generating', we can divide the loop into sections in $U-M$, $M$ and $V-M$, where $M=U\cap V$.
			- Since they're disjoint, the loops must be independent.
				- But may not commute.
				- This point is a bit tricky.

- ((63d8d0b2-907b-40cc-9de2-cd4e81471a48)) (Seifert-van Kampen theorem, classical version) Assume the hypotheses of the preceding theorem. Let $$j: \pi_1\left(U, x_0\right) * \pi_1\left(V, x_0\right) \longrightarrow \pi_1\left(X, x_0\right)$$ be the homomorphism of the free product that extends the homomorphisms $j_1$ and $j_2$ induced by inclusion. Then $j$ is **surjective**, and its kernel is the least normal subgroup $N$ of the free product that contains all elements represented by words of the form $$\left(i_1(g)^{-1}, i_2(g)\right)$$ for $g \in \pi_1\left(U \cap V, x_0\right)$ #card
	- Plain English
		- $\pi_1(X)$ is the free product of $\pi_1(U)$ and $\pi_1(V)$, quotients (the least normal subgroup generated by) trivial loops in $U \cap V$
		- Obviously we can use the theorem to obtain a huge variety of fundamental groups, such as multi-genus tori!

	- Deduce the classical version from the modern one, my version

		- ![Image(1).png](../assets/Image(1)_1675156444668_0.png)
			- The modern version.
			- Moreover, $\Phi$ is surjective from the definition of free groups.
		- ![Image(1).png](../assets/Image(1)_1675156467274_0.png)
			- Universal property of free product
			- Moreover, j is surjective from a theorem.
		- ![Image(1).png](../assets/Image(1)_1675156489170_0.png)
			- Consistency requires that j factors through $\pi$
		- Both $\Phi$ and $\tilde j$ are surjective, so we conclude that the two groups are isomorphic.
			- I believe this claim is true, but it is deeper than it seems at first sight.
				- For instance, consider the homomorphism $Z \to 2Z$. Inclusion doesn't exclude isomorphism.
	- Official proof
		- Essentially the same. He just goes one step further to show $j$ and $\Phi$ are actually inverses of each other.
