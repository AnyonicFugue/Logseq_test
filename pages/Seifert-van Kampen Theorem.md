  Let $H$ be a group, and let $$\phi_1: \pi_1\left(U, x_0\right) \longrightarrow H \quad \text { and } \quad \phi_2: \pi_1\left(V, x_0\right) \longrightarrow H$$ be homomorphisms.

  If $\phi_1 \circ i_1=\phi_2 \circ i_2$, then there exists a unique homomorphism $\Phi: \pi_1\left(X, x_0\right) \rightarrow H$ such that $\Phi \circ j_1=\phi_1$ and $\Phi \circ j_2=\phi_2$. #card
	- Plain English (Also a mnemonic)
		- This theorem says that if $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are arbitrary homomorphisms that are "**compatible** on $U \cap V$," then they can be uniquely extended to a homomorphism $\pi_1(X,x_0)\to H$.
			- Unique extension of homs is a common construction in the categorical view. #[[System/Math and Physics]]
	- Intuition
		- First, since $U\cap V$ is path-connected, $\pi_1(X)$ can be generated by $\pi_1(U)$ and $\pi_1(V)$.
		- 'Compatible' grants that we can obtain $\Phi$ by 'gluing' $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, i.e. $\Phi(g)=\phi_1(a_1)\phi_2(b_1)...\phi_1(a_n)\phi_2(b_n)$
		- Composition property is manifest. It remains to check $\Phi$ is well defined, which is equivalent to mapping e to e.
		- Q: When do we obtain trivial loops?
		  background-color:: purple
			- As in the proof of 'generating', we can divide the loop into sections in $U-M$, $M$ and $V-M$, where $M=U\cap V$.
			- Since they're disjoint, the loops must be independent.
				- But may not commute.
				- This point is a bit tricky.

	  Let $p \in S^1$ and let $a=h(p)$; let $k:\left(S^1, p\right) \rightarrow(A, a)$ be the map obtained by restricting $h$. Then $$i_*: \pi_1(A, a) \longrightarrow \pi_1(X, a)$$ is **surjective**, and its kernel is the least normal subgroup of $\pi_1(A, a)$ containing the image of $k_*: \pi_1\left(S^1, p\right) \rightarrow \pi_1(A, a)$. #card
		- Intuition
			- We sometimes say that the fundamental group of $X$ is obtained from the fundamental group of $A$ by "killing off" the class $k_*[f]$, since $f$ can be contracted on $h(\operatorname{Int} B^2)$.
				- Note that continuous maps preserve connectedness.
		- Key to the proof
			- We must obtain some sort of property that $h(Open)$ is open.
				- This is achieved by the quotient map. #Strategy
			- I have vaguely similar ideas, but I instead looked for one-point compactification.
			- Is there any way to think more systematically?
			- **Key construction**
				- Remove 0 of $B^2$ to obtain a open set contracting to $S^1$.
		- Official proof
			- Step1. Construct a deformation retraction from $X-x_0$ to $A$.
				- Construct the [[Quotient Map]]
					- $C:=h(B^2)$; $\pi$ is restricting the range of $h$ to $C$.
					- $\pi \times id : B^2 \times I \longrightarrow C \times I$ is a closed map (exercise), thus a quotient map.
						- Since $\pi$ is a quotient map, its restriction to Int $B^2$ is also a quotient map and hence a **homeomorphism**.
					- $$
					  \pi^{\prime}:\left(B^2-0\right) \times I \longrightarrow\left(C-x_0\right) \times I
					  $$
					  is also a quotient map, since its domain is open in $B^2 \times I$ and is saturated with respect to $\pi \times$ id.
					- Why do we need to add a unit interval? #Learning-TODO
				- Take $x_0=h(0)$. We have a deformation retraction from $B^2-0$ to $S^1$.
					- It induces, via the quotient map $\pi^{\prime}$, a deformation retraction of $C-x_0$ onto $\pi\left(S^1\right)$.
				- Thus we have a deformation retraction from $C-x_0$ to $f(S^1)$, which implies $\pi_1(C-x_0)=\pi_1(f(S^1))$. We may extend it to a retraction from $U:=X-x_0$ to $A$ by gluing the identity map on $A-C$.
					- Exercise. Prove it is indeed a deformation retraction by proving continuity and constructing the homotopy.
				- Now since retractions induce isomorphisms of fundamental groups, $\pi_1(A) \cong \pi_1(U)$.
			- Step2. We need to find out how to obtain $\pi_1(X)$ from $\pi_1(U)$.
				- However, $C$ and $A$ are closed, so we can't directly invoke Seifert-Kampen.
				  background-color:: red
				- Since they aren't open, we construct open ones by ourselves!
					- Let $X=U \cup V$, where $V=h(\operatorname{Int}B^2)$
						- $A$ is the deformation retract of $U$, so essentially we are substituting $A$ by some open set retracting to it. #Strategy
							- 兵来将挡水来土掩。It's not open, so we construct something open to replace it!
						- $U \cap V=V-x_0=h(\operatorname{Int}B^2-0)$
							- We know that $h$ is a homeomorphism here.
							- The fundamental group is generated by a loop in $Int B^2$, which is homotopic to $S^1$.

	- ### Wedge of circles
		- Definition. Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space that is the union of the subspaces $S_1, \ldots, S_n$, each of which is homeomorphic to the unit circle $S^1$. Assume that there is a point $p$ of $X$ such that $S_i \cap S_j=\{p\}$ whenever $i \neq j$. Then $X$ is called the **wedge of the circles** $S_1, \ldots, S_n$.
		- Theorem. $\pi_1(X)$ is a free group with generators $f_1,...,f_n$
		- Infinite version
			- Definition. Let $X$ be a space that is the union of the subspaces $S_\alpha$, for $\alpha \in J$, each of which is homeomorphic to the unit circle. Assume there is a point $p$ of $X$ such that $S_\alpha \cap S_\beta=\{p\}$ whenever $\alpha \neq \beta$. If the topology of $X$ is **coherent** with the subspaces $S_\alpha$, then $X$ is called the **wedge of the circles** $S_\alpha$.
			- Theorem. $\pi_1(X, p)$ is a free group, with the loops $\left\{f_\alpha\right\}$ representing a system of free generators for $\pi_1(X, p)$.
	- ### Another way for the fundamental group of the [[Torus]]
		- ((63db5d04-9f31-4092-9dc4-bb8447e6e7f0)) #Strategy
		- Consider the torus in the following way
			- Restrict the covernng map $p \times p$ to the unit square.
				- A quotient $\operatorname{map} \pi: I^2 \rightarrow T$. It maps Bd $I^2$ onto the subspace $A=\left(S^1 \times b_0\right) \cup\left(b_0 \times S^1\right)$, which is the wedge of two circles
				- Maps the rest of $I^2$ bijectively onto $M:=T-A$.
			- Thus, $T$ can be thought of as the space obtained by **pasting** the edges of the square $I^2$ onto the space $A$.
		- First observations
			- $\pi_1(A)=Free(2)$, while $\pi_1(M)$ is trivial.
			- They're disjoint.
				- Can we carefully add something (eg. Half the vertical boundary) to connect the two things, thus invoking Serfert-van Kampen? #card

					- No. SK only applies to U and V **open**.
		- Actually we should invoke this [theorem](((63db6326-2852-429b-acc7-21e25d249828))).
