- # Summary of the Approach
	- ## Starting Axioms
		- They are assumed rather than proved, though they seem well reasonable.
		- Approach 1
			- The entanglement area law
			  $$
			  S(A)=\alpha \ell-\gamma
			  $$
		- Approach 2
			- ((65893cf9-7cea-42bf-a2e0-9fb81e10022e)) and ((65893d02-16ab-46c9-b8df-4a6ca6d79925))
			- Note that these axioms follow from approach 1, however they are easier for computation.
	- No Hamiltonian is needed. Only a global states satisfying entropic constraints is necessary.
	- The notion of an 'information convex set' is central.

	- Questions
		- Why are they so many different approaches leading to similar results?
		- Are the results complete?
	- MPS approach and difficulty for higher-dimensional systems #card
		- In 1D...
			- ((658936e0-d90a-4803-968a-b22fac61436a)) implies that gapped states obey area-law entanglement. See ((654078ce-2ffb-4f24-be56-31c8887e8cb9)).
			- Another theorem then implies we can approximate the ground state by [[MPS]] efficiently.
		- In 2D and higher...
			- No guarantee for area-law.
			- Even for area-law states, MPS might not be efficient!
	- Conclusion: Approaches other than MPS is needed!

	- TQFT approach?
		- It is generally believed that TQFT is complete in 2D, but [[Fracton]] (in 3D) is outside TQFT.
		- Moreover, how to prove it from first principles?
		-
	- This motivates the third approach in the paper, i.e. from entanglement.
