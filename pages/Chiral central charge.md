- An [[Anomaly]]-free stable 2D topo order C can have [[Gapless]] 1D [[Boundary]].
	- Which conditions (anomaly-free, stable, 2D, gapless) are necessary and why?
- [[Thermal Hall effect]]
	- The [[Gapless modes]] carry energy and leads to thermal transport. ((637599b5-d072-44de-8459-7c40afe5e491))
	  ((637599bd-cc42-4af4-b765-8512a20fd303))
	- ## c is called the chiral central charge.
