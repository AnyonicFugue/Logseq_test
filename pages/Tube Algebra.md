	- Addition is from the space of states.
		- The meaning of adding operators is not clear.
		-
	- Multiplication is from operators.
		- We have the concept of fusion, but multiplication of strings doesn't directly fit into fusion.
		-
		- On the other hand, multiplication of states doesn't seem to make sense directly...
		  BUT, if we select a reference state (the ground state is a natural choice), then states might correspond to nonlocal operators (1-to-1?), thus could be given a structure of multiplication!
			- Generally, a state couldn't uniquely identify an operator creating it from vacuum. Is there anything special here?
			- If we only allow infinite operators to the left size, then each anyon sectors **does** correpond 1-to-1 to strings!
