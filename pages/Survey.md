- How to do a survey?
	- If I'm learning an existing field (e.g. [[Survey/Entanglement in Field Theory]]), do not write detailed definitions and theorems in the page.
	  Write main ideas, goals, current situations and possibilities.
		- 'The bird eye view'
	- If I'm playing with my own ideas (e.g. Anti toric code), then write down details for future reference -- I have nothing to look up, except for my own writings!
