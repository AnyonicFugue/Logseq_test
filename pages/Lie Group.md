- Def
	- A group that is also a finite-dimensional smooth [[Manifold]], such that the multiplication and inversion are both smooth.
	- We may further require that the manifold is **closed**, which gives many good properties.
	- Matrix Lie group

		- ((6381bb1b-bd7f-4e67-8380-1a111a50408c)). However, most Lie groups we consider do have this property.
		- A general Lie group might not be a matrix Lie group. But we hardly need to consider such exotic groups :p

			  To be an isomorphism, the inverse map must also be continuous.
				- But the map shall be smooth for manifolds?
					- For most homomorphisms we see, it is satisfied.
				- Could we deduce smoothness from continuity?
					- The group multiplication is smooth.

		- ((639330f5-2eca-4f75-93cf-3fd1f6f9fe12)) There is a continuous bijection between $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ and $\mathbb{R} P^3$, thus $SO(3)$ isn't simply connected. #card

			- Note that $\mathbb{R} P^3$ is obtained by identifying points in $\mathbb R^4$.
			- Intuition
				- A rotation always has a principle axis. Thus the topological structure of $SO(3)$ is analogous to a 'direction' and an 'angle'.
				- The latter is isomorphic to $S_1$.

				- Lemma 4.38. If $X$ is a nilpotent matrix and $e^{t X}=I$ for some nonzero $t$, then $X=0$.
					- Simple way: Jordan standard form.
						- All eigenvalues are 0.
						- Only to consider the blocks where all up-diagonal terms are 1.
						- Consider the second-lowest line. Only first-order term has the nonzero up-diagonal term. So $e^tX=I$ leads to a contradiction.
					- Official proof: Rather interesting.
						- Since $X$ is nilpotent, the power series for $e^{t X}$ terminates after a finite number of terms. Thus, each entry of $e^{t X}$ depends **polynomially** on $t$; that is, there exist polynomials $p_{j k}(t)$ such that $\left(e^{t X}\right)_{j k}=p_{j k}(t)$.
						- If $e^{t X}=I$ for some nonzero $t$, then $e^{n t X}=I$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, showing that $p_{j k}(n t)=\delta_{j k}$ for all $n$. **However, a polynomial that takes on a certain value infinitely many times must be constant**. Thus, actually, $e^{t X}=I$ for all $t$.
				- Then consider the associated rep for $\mathfrak h$.
			- Thus the rep of $G$ cannot be faithful.
