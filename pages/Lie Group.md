- Def
	- A group that is also a finite-dimensional smooth [[Manifold]], such that the multiplication and inversion are both smooth.
	- We may further require that the manifold is **closed**, which gives many good properties.
	- Matrix Lie group
		- ((6381bb48-3345-4b06-bbe2-aac3d6c38dde))
		- ((6381bb1b-bd7f-4e67-8380-1a111a50408c)). However, most Lie groups we consider do have this property.
		- A general Lie group might not be a matrix Lie group. But we hardly need to consider such exotic groups :p

			- ((6381bdc6-e0b4-4d4d-91e3-aeb15dce7e60))
			  To be an isomorphism, the inverse map must also be continuous.
			- All structures must correspond.

	- Connectedness
	  collapsed:: true
		- In Lie groups, [[Connected]] is equivalent to [[Path Connected]]
		- The ((6381bc92-5f90-4322-9a1b-0cbbf9128acc)) is a normal subgroup. #card
			- A simple exercise. Directly construct the path.

			- We may construct a homeomorphism to $S^3$ by 
			  $$
			  A=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
			  \alpha & -\bar{\beta} \\
			  \beta & \bar{\alpha}
			  \end{array}\right)
			  $$
				- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are arbitrary complex numbers satisfying $|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1$
		- ((639330f5-2eca-4f75-93cf-3fd1f6f9fe12)) There is a continuous bijection between $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ and $\mathbb{R} P^3$, thus $SO(3)$ isn't simply connected. #card

			- Note that $\mathbb{R} P^3$ is obtained by identifying points in $\mathbb R^4$.
			- Intuition
				- A rotation always has a principle axis. Thus the topological structure of $SO(3)$ is analogous to a 'direction' and an 'angle'.
				- The latter is isomorphic to $S_1$.
	- [[Norms of Matrices]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Hilbertâ€“Schmidt norm, or Frobenius norm
			- $\|X\|=\left(\sum_{j, k=1}^n\left|X_{j k}\right|^2\right)^{1 / 2}$
			- See X as an $n^2$-dimensional vector.
			- Properties
				- $\left\|(A-I)^m\right\| \leq\|(A-I)\|^m$
	- [[Matrix Exponential]]
	- [[Matrix Logarithm]]
		- We hope to define something as an inverse of the matrix exponential.
		  However, a bit knowledge in [[Complex Analysis]] would show that it is impossible to have a global one.
