- # Setup
	- $$
	  H_1=-\sum_p B_p, \quad B_p=-\sigma_p^x \prod_{\left\langle p q q^{\prime}\right\rangle} i^{\frac{1-\sigma_q^z \sigma^z_{q^{\prime}}}{2}}
	  $$
		- ((660bef61-62e8-4cad-8314-08ca2390f132))
- # Ground State
	- Prop. The ground state $\Psi_1$ is a superposition of all domain wall configurations, but each configuration enters with a sign $(-1)^{N_{d w}}$ where $N_{d w}$ is the total number of domain walls.
		- ((660bf03c-6661-48a7-973c-10f61f7b26e4))
		- Note that 
		  $$\prod_{\left\langle p q q^{\prime}\right\rangle} i^{\frac{1-\sigma_q^z \sigma^z_{q^{\prime}}}{2}}$$
		  includes a factor of $i$ for each pair of neighboring spins $q, q^{\prime}$ that have opposite values of $\sigma^z$.
			- In particular, since the number of such pairs is necessarily even, the product always reduces to a factor of $\pm 1$.
- # Symmetry and Gauging
	- The symmetry is
	  $$
	  S=\prod_p \sigma_p^x
	  $$
		- Note that the ground state is gapped and unique, so the symmetry is not broken spontaneously.
