- However, the coarse-grained wave function is **not** the product state formed by spin-singlets on each site, but the product state formed by spin-singlets **between sites**.

- In other words, the product state formed by spin-singlets on each site and the product state formed by spin-singlets between sites belong to two different phases, provided that the spin-singlets are formed by projective representations of SO(3)

- Now we know that such spin-1 boundary degrees of freedom are not protected by symmetry since they can be gapped out by adding several spin-2 degrees of freedom to the boundary without breaking the SO(3) symmetry. Thus the spin-2 Haldane phase is a trivial SPT phase [67].

- SPT phases cannot have a trivial gapped boundary [71, 72]: the boundary must be gapless, symmetry breaking, or topologically ordered
