- # Thought
	- Consider how the properties change **asymptotically** with the size (or some characteristic scale).
		- The reason for considering the asymptotic behavior is we almost only see things at the [[Thermodynamic limit]].
	- Consequently, lots of details can be discarded; we grasp the most salient behavior.
		- Though sometimes details matter a lot, but that's another thing! All methods fail at some time.
