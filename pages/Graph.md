- Def
	- A (finite) linear graph $G$ is a Hausdorff space that is written as the union of finitely many arcs, each pair of which intersect in **at most one** common end point.
	- The arcs are called the **edges** of the graph, and the end points of the arcs are called the **vertices** of the graph.
- Examples
	- Complete graph
		- If $G$ contains exactly $n$ vertices, and if for every pair of distinct vertices of $G$ there is an edge of $G$ joining them, then $G$ is called the complete graph on $n$ vertices and is denoted $G_n$.
	- Utility graph
		- Connect 3 houses to 3 utilities, without any intersection.
	- Theta space

		- A theta space $X$ is a Hausdorff space that is written as the union of three arcs $A, B$, and $C$, each pair of which intersect precisely in their end points.
			- Actually it is not a graph, but we can make it one by breaking some arcs into two.
