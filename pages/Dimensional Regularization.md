- # Idea
	- Compute the Feynman diagram as an analytic function of the dimensionality of spacetime. Take $d \to 4$ in the end.
		- This seems problematic. Generally physics depends sensitively on the spacetime dimension, not to mention the strangeness of non-integer dimensions.
		- Though non-integer dimensions makes a bit sense via [[Gamma Function]] .
	- (3+1)D is very special; it incurs divergences, behaviors away from mean-field theories, etc. #Thoughts
