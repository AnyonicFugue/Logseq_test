- Def #card
	- Let $A$ be a subspace of $X$. $A$ is a *deformation retract* of $X$ if the identity map of $X$ is **homotopic to a retraction**, such that each point of $A$ remains fixed during the homotopy.
	- The homotopy $H$ is called a *deformation retraction* of $X$ onto $A$.
	- Actually a special case of [[Homotopy Equivalence]], i.e. preserve some points during the homotopy. Thus we can preserve the base point of $\pi_1$.
