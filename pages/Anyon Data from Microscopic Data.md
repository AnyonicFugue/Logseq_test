- The main result comes from [[2015_Moradi_Wen_Universal Wave Function Overlap and Universal]].
	- There are different techniques to simplify the calculation, e.g. PEPS, TRG, etc.
- ![2015_You_Cheng_Measuring Modular Matrices by Shearing Lattices.pdf](file://zotero_link/Research/Anyon Data from Microscopic Data/2015_You_Cheng_Measuring Modular Matrices by Shearing Lattices.pdf) provides a concrete example of calculation, which obtains the data of Ising anyons.
