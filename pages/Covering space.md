		- Definition. Let $p : E \rightarrow B$ be a continuous surjective map. The open set $U$ of $B$ is said to be **evenly covered** by $p$ if the inverse image $p^{-1}(U)$ can be written as the union of **disjoint** open sets $V_\alpha$ in $E$ such that for each $\alpha$, the restriction of $p$ to $V_\alpha$ is a **homeomorphism** of $V_\alpha$ onto $U$ The collection $\left\{V_\alpha\right\}$ will be called a partition of $p^{-1}(U)$ into slices
			- In other words, E contains several disjoint copies of U, which are 'squashed into one' by p.

			- Let $p: E \rightarrow B$ be continuous and surjective. If every point $b$ of $B$ **has a neighborhood** $U$ that is evenly covered by $p$, then $p$ is called a covering map, and $E$ is said to be a covering space of $B$
				- This is not a very [[Global]] property. Each point can only be sliced [[Locally]]

			- A [[Covering map]] is a [[Local homeomorphism]], but not vice versa. See ((63784a35-429c-434a-a01b-37cf86a8a1b4)).
			  collapsed:: true
				- The map is 'broken' near the origin.
	- Examples
		- ((63784918-925a-4fa9-97fb-8d3e8841d3d3))
		  We can construct a covering of $$T^2=S^1\times S^1$$ by $$R\times R$$ in this way.
		- $p:S^1\to S^1$ by $$p(\theta)=2\theta$$
