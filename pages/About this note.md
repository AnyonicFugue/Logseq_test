- This note is written in [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) and published using [pengx17/logseq-publish](https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-publish). Hats off to the great projects!
- I do most of my learnings in Logseq.
	- Logseq provides most necessary functionalities: PDF reader with excerpting, infinite nesting, searching, Latex support, etc.
	- However, Logseq isn't only a tool to go through PDFs and store everything I've learned. There are also several game-changing advantages.
		- Bidirectional linking: The notes become a huge interlinked nest of knowledge and thoughts.
		- Spaced-repetition system: Memorize everything I've learned with a very low cost!
		- Low mental cost: If I have an idea but don't know where to put it, just create a new page. Linking and searching ensure that I can find it in the future.

	- I believe that modern softwares would reshape and supercharge the learning process. Human brains have limitations; computers can help us to overcome them.
		- I've painlessly memorized about a thousand English words by Anki.
		- Logseq has further made my learning about 2x faster.
