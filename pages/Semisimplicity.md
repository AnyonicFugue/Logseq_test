- Definition
	- ((636dfac4-b7e4-415e-878e-fdeac5efcd9d))
	- In practice we may define a finite semisimple category as $$\operatorname{Vec}^{\oplus n}$$
	- Note that there are different definitions.
- Properties
	- Every finite semisimple category is ((636ca217-d22e-42b8-984f-f4f35d530948)).
		- The homs can be seen as block-diagonal matrices, because different copies of $$Vec$$ are disjoint.
		- So we need to consider a matrix A with $$A^2=A$$.
		  A familiar exercise in [[Linear Algebra]].

	- In other words, the level of the category of ((636879d9-dfe3-4bdd-a078-587cc9c25350)) only depends on the dimension of the defects, not the dimension of the topo order.
