- The real difference between fermionic and bosonic should be **locality**.
	- In $d=1$ there is not much difference, since after a JW transformation, local in the bosonic sense <-> local in the fermionic sense (fermion parity imposed).
	- However, in $d \geq 2$ things can get very different, since a JW transformation would leave a 2D trace behind, which might not be canceled.

- Proposition. $Z_2^f$ originates from locality.

	- In short, we should have a local Hamiltonian
	  $$
	  H=\sum_n H_n
	  $$
	  with
	  $$\lim_{|n-m| \to \infty}[H_m,H_n]=0$$
	- Note that $[c_m,c_n] \neq 0$.

	- $$(-1)^{a_k^\dagger a_k}=-i \gamma_{2k-1}\gamma_{2k}$$
	- Therefore
	  $$(-1)^{\sum_k a_k^\dagger a_k}=(-i)^N \prod_k \gamma_{2k-1}\gamma_{2k}$$
