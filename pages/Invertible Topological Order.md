# Def
	- Invertible under [[Stacking]]
- # Belief
	- A topological order is invertible if and only if they do not have nontrivial topological excitations.
	- An invertible TO is nontrivial (long-range entangled) if and only if it has nonzero [[Chiral central charge]].
- # Examples
	- IQH states, Chern insulator, quantum anomalous Hall state, etc.
