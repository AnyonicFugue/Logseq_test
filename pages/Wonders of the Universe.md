  The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible. - Albert Einstein

	- More strikingly, elegant math structures can naturally describe almost all sorts of physics. Why math fits so well with physics?
		- Linear algebra describes quantum mechanics unreasonably well.
		- Lie group and gauge theory, differential geometry and general relativity.
- # Everything is up to a [[Phase Factor]].
  collapsed:: true
	- Where does the phase pop up in QM?
		- Berry phase
		-
	- Can we reformulate quantum mechanics in terms of [[Projective Space]]? #[[Open problem]]
		- The global wavefunction can always be normalized.
		- Problems
			- How to express superpositions of states?
			- How to express evolution?
- # Lagrangian -- the quantity to be minimized -- can be connected with Hamiltonian -- the quantity governing evolution -- by an elegant transformation!
  collapsed:: true
	- Even in QFT, where they become operators.
		- Is it only a coincidence, because we perform canonical quantization from the classical theories?
- # Existence of Temperature
  collapsed:: true
	- In the 'fundamental' laws of physics (QFT, GR), there seem to be no place for temperature.
	- But we sense it every day and it emerges in various aspects.
	- What's temperature?
		- Often interpreted as incompleteness of information.
		- Problems
			- Could temperature emerge in a pure quantum state?
				- If not so, then what about the universe, which is believed to be in a pure state?
	- Implying a deep connection with quantum information?
- # Mysteries of the (3+1)D Spacetime
- # [[Renormalization]]
	- [[Bare]] quantities $m_0$ and $e_0$ are not measurable; what we see is only things after renormalization (which means lots of inseparable physical processes).
		- Reminiscent of the relativity principle: The gravity could **never be separated**, thus a kind of **background**.

	- ## [[Entanglement]]
	- ## Measurement
		- Why measurement collapses states? So weird...
