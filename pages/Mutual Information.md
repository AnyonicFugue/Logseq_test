- Def #card
	- $$
	  I_{A B}=S_A+S_B-S_{A \cup B}
	  $$
	- Intuitively, how much one can infer about the other subsystem if one knows about one subsystem.
		- If the whole system is in a pure state but $S_A$ and $S_B$ are at the maximum, this means that each eigenstate of $\rho_A$ **1-1 corresponds** to another of $\rho_B$. Thus $I_{AB}$ reaches it maximum.
		- If the density matrix of the whole system is a product of two sub density matrices, then $A$ and $B$ are **independent**, thus $I_{AB}$=0
