			- Kitaev's talks in KITP. Cited by many...
			- Maybe also search for them on Youtube.
		- QFT in curved spacetime
			- Would a compact space lead to countable degrees of freedom and remove the divergences?
				- I guess not (since we don't know theories at high energy scales), but this also helps to understand the role of the spacetime manifold.
		- Local field theory and algebraic QFT
			- The notion of superselection sectors first emerged in local field theory.
			- Also, the viewpoint of operator algebra must be very interesting!
		- Phase transitions
			- KT phase transition
			- (Deconfined) quantum criticality
		- Mott insulators
			- How topological (LRE) it is?
		- QC
			- Experimental realizations and their difficulties
				- This is one thing to keep in mind, where unexpected ideas might pop up.
		- Integrable systems, especially quantum integrable systems
			- Seems not just 'obtain an explicit solution', but with much deeper structures (algebraic geometry, conserved flows on an manifold, etc.)
