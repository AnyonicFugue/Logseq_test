		- ### Basics
			- Fundamental to my map of knowledge, would be used repeatedly in advanced learning.
			- 不要吝啬在此处的投入，因为这里的投入会以数倍在未来兑现。
			- 类似于基础建设。
			- **Examples**
				- Representation Theory (of finite groups, of algebras, etc.)
				- Lie Groups and Lie Algebras, especially reps. of $SU(2)$ and $SU(N)$
				- Differential Geometry
		- ### Essential to my research
			- Not used intensively in other places.
			- 类似于定投。
			- **Examples**
				- Tensor Categories
				- Higher Symmetry
		- ### Thoughts of maestros
			- Not to learn specific knowledge, but to learn how did the maestros think.
			- {{embed ((648bc940-0069-4088-938c-ce5cc272d71d))}}
		- ### Exploration
			- Learn new topics and new tools.
				- “广度与深度同样重要”。
			- 可能没啥用（当然可以培养品位），但一旦派上用场很可能是惊天动地的。类似于风险投资。
			- **Examples**
				- Algebraic Geometry
				- Number Theory

				- 为什么四维是个临界维数？
		- p-adic
		- Dynamic systems & Integrable systems
			- Why it is usually claimed 'exactly diagonalizable systems have infinitely many conserved quantities'? Isn't it that every Hamiltonian can be diagonalized?
		- Convex and discrete geometry & Graph Theory
			- May be useful in lattice systems, but not too sure.
			  I can first overview the key ideas and important theorems.

			- Kitaev's talks in KITP. Cited by many...
			- Maybe also search for them on Youtube.
		- QFT in curved spacetime
			- Would a compact space lead to countable degrees of freedom and remove the divergences?
				- I guess not (since we don't know theories at high energy scales), but this also helps to understand the role of the spacetime manifold.
		- Mott insulators
			- How topological (LRE) it is?
		- QC
			- Experimental realizations and their difficulties
				- This is one thing to keep in mind, where unexpected ideas might pop up.
		- Integrable systems, especially quantum integrable systems
			- Seems not just 'obtain an explicit solution', but with much deeper structures (algebraic geometry, conserved flows on an manifold, etc.)
