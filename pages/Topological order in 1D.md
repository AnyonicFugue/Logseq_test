			- Similarly, simple excitations are 1 and M.
		- Do we lose information on the boundary, since e and 1 seems indistinguishable on the rough boundary? #card
		  collapsed:: true
			- NO.
			- We can use [[Braiding]] to reveal that the type of excitation exists in the bulk.

			- Note that **there are no e present on the boundary**. We just used a string operator associated with e.
			  In other word, the existence of such nontrivial string operator reveals the type in the [[Bulk]].
