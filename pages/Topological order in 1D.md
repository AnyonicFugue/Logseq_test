			- Similarly, simple excitations are 1 and M.
		- Do we lose information on the boundary, since e and 1 seems indistinguishable on the rough boundary? #card
		  collapsed:: true
			- NO.
			- We can use [[Braiding]] to reveal that the type of excitation exists in the bulk.

			- Note that **there are no e present on the boundary**. We just used a string operator associated with e.
			  In other word, the existence of such nontrivial string operator reveals the type in the [[Bulk]].

			- Somewhat analogous to 'inequivalent homotopies between two paths'.

				- Which conditions are necessary?
			- (a) The bulk-to-boundary map $F: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ is a [[Central functor]].
			  (b) The central structure $F^{\prime}: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathfrak{Z}_1(\mathcal{A})$ is a braided equivalence.
				- (b) gives an interesting restriction: An anomaly-free stable 2D topological order must be a [[Drinfeld center]] of something else.
				- Conversely, the theorem immediately implies that the [[Drinfeld center]] is nondegenerate. Mathematically, ((637ad683-2c60-43af-868c-f7eaacd40528))

		- Seems quite strange but interesting.
		- Intuitively, we have the following structures
			- Left [[bulk-to-boundary map]] $F: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}$ and the right one $G: \overline{\mathcal{D}} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}$. Note that D is a [[Time-reversed category]]
			- The total [[bulk-to-boundary map]] $F \times G: \mathcal{C} \times \overline{\mathcal{D}} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}$
				- Actually the [[Deligne tensor product]], but I don't know how to type it in LaTex.
