	- Let $G$ be a matrix Lie group. A finite-dimensional complex representation of $G$ is a Lie group homomorphism
	  $$
	  \Pi: G \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}(V),
	  $$
	  where $V$ is a finite-dimensional complex vector space (with $\operatorname{dim}(V) \geq 1$ ).
		- A finite-dimensional real representation of $G$ is a Lie group homomorphism $\Pi$ of $G$ into $\operatorname{GL}(V)$, where $V$ is a finite-dimensional real vector space.
	- If $\mathfrak{g}$ is a real or complex Lie algebra, then a finite-dimensional complex representation of $\mathfrak{g}$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism 
	  $$\pi:\mathfrak{g} \to g l(V)$$
	  , where $V$ is a finite-dimensional complex vector space.
- ((63e44c94-f6b7-45ad-86c7-a5068ae7d4b6)) If G is a **compact** matrix Lie group, every finite-dimensional representation of G is unitary, thus completely reducible. #card

	- The strategy is to construct an invariant inner product by integral on the group.
		- Introduce an elegant structure on the object. #Strategy
		- Quite strange! The inner product is completely absent in the beginning. We constructed it, and its existence leads to many profound insights.
		-
		- More generally, how do we know that we should introduce a certain kind of structure?
			- Most of us just think of all known structures and try each one at random.
			  Indeed, each structure could lead to different insights (though not your initial destination).
			- Is there any better strategy? What if we want to introduce a structure which doesn't exist yet?
