# [[Questions]]
	- Could all topological data be obtained from a single ground state?
		- This concerns the definition of topological phases, since GSD only occurs on specific manifolds.
		- However, Kong claims that 'TO are defined on infinite open disks', where the notion of GSD is dubious.
- # Significance
	- [[Entanglement]] is deeply related with [[Thermalization]].
		- Intuition: Local thermalization -> Long-range entanglement
	- Quantum info provide proxies for certain kinds of classical hardness, thus helping to understand ((63e86248-136d-4d42-9012-f111fcc231cc))
- # Thoughts
	- 'If you work too hard you get nothing'. Equal-weight superposition of all configurations doesn't work, but partial sum does.
	- Low-entanglement states can be approximated by states with a small Schmidt number (nonzero eigenvalues of reduced density matrices)
- # Properties
	- Monogamy

		- For example, if AB is a Bell state and BC is also a Bell state, there cannot be an extension of these density matrices into a single state acting on ABC.
		- Even stronger, if AB is maximally entangled, then they cannot entangle with a third state C!
			- But what is maximally entangled actually?

	- [[0705.2024] An Area Law for One Dimensional Quantum Systems (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2024) proves that entanglement gapped 1D quantum systems could at most scale as area law.
	- [[cond-mat/0305505] Lieb-Schultz-Mattis in Higher Dimensions (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0305505) and [[cond-mat/0405587] Locality in Quantum and Markov Dynamics on Lattices and Networks (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0405587) showed the exponential decay of correlation functions.
