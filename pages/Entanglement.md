- # Significance
	- [[Entanglement]] is deeply related with [[Thermalization]].
		- Intuition: Local thermalization -> Long-range entanglement
	- Quantum info provide proxies for certain kinds of classical hardness, thus helping to understand ((63e86248-136d-4d42-9012-f111fcc231cc))

- # What structures can describe it?
	- Do we need to describe a distribution, a correlation, or some higher structure?
		- Distribution (at single point) seems not satisfactory. We only know how mixed the state is, but don't know whom it mixes with.
		- Note that distribution is 1-point correlation.

	- Blind guess: Sheaf
	- Should we describe a particular state, or try to describe the ground state of a Hamiltonian?
		- The latter seems not so practical. What if it is degenerate?
- # Thoughts
	- 'If you work too hard you get nothing'. Equal-weight superposition of all configurations doesn't work, but partial sum does.
	- The emerging structure of [[UMTC]] implies something deeper behind the stage.
	- ## Must be related to the fundamental properties of QM
		- ### What happens when we superpose states?
		- ### 'Redundancy' of phase
			- TODO Link with wonders of the universe, then delete the line
	- Low-entanglement states can be approximated by states with a small Schmidt number (nonzero eigenvalues of reduced density matrices)
