- # Significance
	- [[Entanglement]] is deeply related with [[Thermalization]].
		- Intuition: Local thermalization -> Long-range entanglement
	- Quantum info provide proxies for certain kinds of classical hardness, thus helping to understand ((63e86248-136d-4d42-9012-f111fcc231cc))

- # Thoughts
	- 'If you work too hard you get nothing'. Equal-weight superposition of all configurations doesn't work, but partial sum does.
	- Low-entanglement states can be approximated by states with a small Schmidt number (nonzero eigenvalues of reduced density matrices)
