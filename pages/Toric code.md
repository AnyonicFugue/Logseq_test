- How to prove there are only 4 simple topo ((636879d9-dfe3-4bdd-a078-587cc9c25350)) and thus labelled? They can't be connected by local operators?
   #Problem
- [[Ribbon]] structure

	- He doesn't write the [[Dual structure]]. Instead, he just moved the particle along a circle.
	  Is this equivalent to Double [[Braiding]] with vacuum? If not, why? How to explicitly write out the creators and annihilators? #Problem
- ## Explicitly calculate all relevent structures and write them in the familiar operator form: Dual, Ribbon, Braiding, etc. #TODO
	- [[Fusion]]
		- Note that I may need to select a homotopy class. There is a convenient choice: those not crossing the left and right 'borders'.
		- Also I shall fix how e and m fuse.
	- Given n pairs of excitations (at different locations), the pairs can always be connected with nonintersecting paths. Because a path doesn't change the [[Path connectedness]] of the [[Torus]].
