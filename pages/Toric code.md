- Actually $Z_2$ [[Quantum Double]]
- Solution
	- 4 ground states <-> 4 homotopy classes.
		- ((6368789c-5189-4377-a4a7-55516a81ee18))
		- ((636878d9-84fc-418a-a61c-90845774d77f))
	- Counting the ground state degeneracy
		- Total d.o.f: $F=2n^2$
		- Constraints: $E+V-2$
		- Free d.o.f. : $N=F-E-V+2=2g$
- How to prove there are only 4 simple topo ((636879d9-dfe3-4bdd-a078-587cc9c25350)) and thus labelled? They can't be connected by local operators?
   #Problem
	- The excitations can only be $A_v=-1$ or $B_p=-1$. But is this sufficient?
- [[Ribbon]] structure
  collapsed:: true
	- ((6371a8f3-e2d5-4eb9-91e3-e0342be2efcc))
	- He doesn't write the [[Dual structure]]. Instead, he just moved the particle along a circle.
	  Is this equivalent to Double [[Braiding]] with vacuum? If not, why? How to explicitly write out the creators and annihilators? #Problem

		- Stabilizers and logical states #card
			- $A_v$, $B_p$ as the stabilizers of the code. Flips are regarded as errors.
			- Ground space (different homotopy types) as the logical space.
		- Logical operators #card
			- There are 4 string operators: $X_1,X_2,Z_1,Z_2$.
			- $X_1$ commutes with $X_2$ and $Z_2$. Similar for others.
			- We may select any 2 commuting operators as logical X. Those anti-commuting would be logical Z.
				- Note those operators aren't universal.
			- We obtain two qubits, but only **single-qubit** gates.
			- Problem: The gates seem not universal.
- ## Explicitly calculate all relevent structures and write them in the familiar operator form: Dual, Ribbon, Braiding, etc. #TODO
	- [[Fusion]]
		- Note that I may need to select a homotopy class. There is a convenient choice: those not crossing the left and right 'borders'.
		- Also I shall fix how e and m fuse.
	- Given n pairs of excitations (at different locations), the pairs can always be connected with nonintersecting paths. Because a path doesn't change the [[Path Connectedness]] of the [[Torus]].
