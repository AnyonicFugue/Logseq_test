- # 1D Antipodal Bell Pairs
  id:: 64ca755f-214a-48fe-9149-da713df20565
	- An 1D ring of 2N sites
	- The stabilizer group is generated by two sets of generators: $\{X_i X_{i+N}\}_{i=1,...,N}$ and $\{Z_i Z_{i+N}\}_{i=1,...,N}$
	- ### Basic Facts
		- There are indeed $2N$ generators to pin down a unique ground state.
			- Actually it is the product of $N$ Bell pairs (i and i+N), though in a highly nonlocal manner.
		- The generators commute with each other.
		- The minimal diameter of any stabilizer (not only generators) is $N+1$.
			- In short, if there is a nontrivial action at the $j^{th}$ site, then the action on $(j+N)^{th}$ site must also be nontrivial.
		- The entanglement of any region is **maximal**.
