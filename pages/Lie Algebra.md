				- Idea
					- Lie groups are **closed**, so a sequence must converge to something inside.
					- Quantities can be approximated by something small enough multiplies integers. #Strategy
				- Partial solutions
					- Since exp is continuous, $e^{t Y_m / \|Y_m\|} \to e^{tY}$
					- If we can show $\log A \in \mathfrak g$, then we have a sequence of group elements on LHS. So RHS must also be in the group.
					  collapsed:: true
						- It seems too good to be true.
				- Official solution
					- $\log A \in \mathfrak g$ is **wrong** in general.
					- But since $B_m \rightarrow I$, we have $\left\|Y_m\right\| \rightarrow 0$. Thus, we can find integers $k_m$ such that $k_m\left\|Y_m\right\| \rightarrow t$
					- $$
					  e^{k_m Y_m}=\exp \left[\left(k_m\left\|Y_m\right\|\right) \frac{Y_m}{\left\|Y_m\right\|}\right] \rightarrow e^{t Y}
					  $$
						- Note that we do not need to show $e^{t Y_m / \|Y_m\|} \in \mathfrak g$.
							- We need a sequence tending to $e^tY$, but still some freedom :)
						- The point is we **construct another sequence**, so that we only need to deal with **integers**.
			- My (suspicious) solution
				- Note that $Y\in \mathfrak g \Leftrightarrow cY \in \mathfrak g$. Moreover, since taking norm is continuous, $\|Y\|=1$
				- We shall construct a sequence $B_m \to I$ s.t. $\frac{\log B_m}{\left\|\log B_m\right\|} \rightarrow \frac{\log A}{\|\log A\|}:=\tilde Y$
					- Reminiscent of the projective space? lol
				- Equivalently, $\forall \epsilon>0$, $\exist B_m$ s.t. $\|\frac{\log B_m}{\left\|\log B_m\right\|} - \frac{\log A}{\|\log A\|}\|<\epsilon$ (While $B_m$ tends to the identity)
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1673763809495_0.png)
						- $\log B_m$ is on the 'projective cone'
						- Indeed it can be arbitrarily close to the origin (so that $B_m \to I$) for arbitrarily small $\epsilon$.
					-
				- $G$ forms a manifold -> Locally connected -> The identity component is open.
					- That is, we can find an open ball contained in the identity component.
					- **Problem**: The identity component is open in G, not necessarily open in $M_n(C)$.
						- Another point of view: Only certain directions (spanned by the Lie algebra) are allowed at the origin. Therefore we cannot find an open ball.
				- Now the problem is I didn't use the condition that $A\in V_\epsilon$; I didn't even require $A\in G$
				  background-color:: red
					- Why doesn't my path work?
			- Wrong attempts
				- We cannot write A as $e^X$, since it is what we are going to prove.
			- Full proof
				- First, $\log A \in \mathfrak g \Rightarrow A \in G$ from ((63c14167-8540-43ba-9aa0-4d1c2bc7cf64)). We just need to prove the other direction.
				- 'Exist a neighborhood' allows us to hypothesize there isn't a neighborhood, then **construct a sequence converging to the point** to derive a contradiction. #Strategy
