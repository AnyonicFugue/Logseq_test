- # What information should be contained in the structure?
	- **Topology** (geometry) of the entanglement of a quantum state
	- *The Hamiltonian?
		- Maybe this shall be a separate aspect, since a Hamiltonian pins down a ground state (or a ground space) but not vice versa.
- # Motivating Questions
	- How to say two states are 'entanglement equivalent'?
		- Physically this could mean locally indistinguishable (more precisely, not linked by local unitaries)
- # Interesting Aspects
	- Symmetry
		- Physical motivations are SPT and SET
	- Hamiltonian
		- Stabilizer codes is a special case, but more copeable
	- Thermodynamic limit

- # Thoughts
	- The emerging structure of [[UMTC]] implies something deeper behind the stage.
		- i.e. There should be a beautiful mathematical structure, where the language of UMTC is especially suitable.

	- Exterior Algebra
		- [exterior algebra in nLab (](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/exterior+algebra)[nLab](http://ncatlab.org)[)](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/exterior+algebra) Generalizable by categories
		- [Exterior algebra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra)
		- The algebra generated by the tensor vector space quotient 'direct product' states.
		- Good news: Find a way to express 'modulo product states'. Moreover, equivalent to modulo the 'bosonic symmetrization'.
		- Shortcomings: 1. Losing the topology (which should be supported by something like a vector bundle) 2. Still we must find a way to resolve the thermodynamic limit
